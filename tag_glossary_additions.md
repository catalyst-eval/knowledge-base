# Suggested Tag Glossary Additions

The following tags have been suggested for addition to the tag glossary:

## self-accommodation

**Suggested definition:**

Strategies for extending the same understanding and accommodations to oneself that one readily provides to others, particularly involving the transfer of insights about neurodivergent needs from children or others to oneself.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
Given the recurring pattern of clients extending understanding to others but not themselves, a dedicated category on self-accommodation would be valuable. This would include techniques for transferring insights about children's needs to oneself, methods for identifying double standards, and practices for developing consistent internal/external support frameworks. #self-accommodation #self-compassion
```

## parent-child-mirroring

**Suggested definition:**

The reciprocal process where parents recognize their own neurodivergent traits in their children, creating therapeutic opportunities for self-understanding and intervention through these parallel recognitions.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The transcript reveals how parenting neurodivergent children creates therapeutic opportunities through mirroring, which deserves systematic framework documentation, including recognition patterns between parent and child traits and intervention possibilities through parental insights about children. #parent-child-mirroring #family-systems
```

## fear-avoidance

**Suggested definition:**

A pattern where fear leads to avoidance behaviors, particularly examining the complex relationship between fear and motivation in neurodivergent individuals and the distinction between interest-based versus fear-based avoidance.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The transcript highlights the complex relationship between fear and motivation in ADHD, which warrants dedicated framework attention, including differentiating between interest-based avoidance and fear-based avoidance and identifying when fear serves protective versus limiting functions. #fear-avoidance #motivation-systems
```

## therapeutic-humor

**Suggested definition:**

The strategic use of humor as a clinical intervention to maintain attention, reduce shame, bypass defenses, and strengthen therapeutic alliance, particularly valuable in neurodivergent therapy contexts.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The transcript demonstrates how humor serves as a powerful engagement tool for maintaining attention and reducing shame in ADHD therapy, including strategic use of humor to maintain attention during challenging topics and as a defense-bypassing mechanism. #therapeutic-humor #engagement-strategies
