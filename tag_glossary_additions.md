# Suggested Tag Glossary Additions

The following tags have been suggested for addition to the tag glossary:

## variotropism

**Suggested definition:**

An attention pattern characterized by scattered, inconsistent focus that shifts based on novelty and stimulation demands, primarily associated with ADHD neurotype but distinct from polytropic attention.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
An attention pattern characterized by scattered, inconsistent focus that shifts based on novelty and stimulation demands, primarily associated with ADHD neurotype but distinct from polytropic attention. This concept helps differentiate ADHD attention patterns from both autistic and neurotypical attention allocation. #neurological-frameworks #variotropism
```

## tropism-attachment-matrix

**Suggested definition:**

An integrated framework that maps how attention styles (monotropism, polytropic, variotropic) interact with attachment patterns, providing insight into relational dynamics for neurodivergent individuals.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
An integrated framework that maps how attention styles (monotropism, polytropic, variotropic) interact with attachment patterns, providing insight into relational dynamics for neurodivergent individuals. This extends beyond typical monotropism theory by explicitly connecting attention patterns to relational dynamics. #systems-perspectives #tropism-attachment-matrix
```

## accommodation-mapping

**Suggested definition:**

A structured approach to documenting and implementing neurodivergent accommodations across different environments, with emphasis on identifying energy expenditure and developing targeted supports.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
A structured approach to documenting and implementing neurodivergent accommodations across different environments, with emphasis on identifying energy expenditure and developing targeted supports. This approach moves beyond ad-hoc accommodations to a systematic mapping across contexts. #practical-strategies #accommodation-mapping
```

## safety-system

**Suggested definition:**

A universal neurobiological framework for understanding protective responses that all humans possess, encompassing fight, flight, freeze, and fawn reactions, which becomes problematic only when chronically activated or imbalanced.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
A universal neurobiological framework for understanding protective responses that all humans possess, encompassing fight, flight, freeze, and fawn reactions, which becomes problematic only when chronically activated or imbalanced. This destigmatizing framework allows for discussion of protective responses without requiring trauma identification. #neurological-frameworks #safety-system
```

## hybrid-response-states

**Suggested definition:**

The simultaneous activation of two or more safety responses (e.g., freeze-flight, fight-fawn), creating unique physiological and psychological experiences that require specific therapeutic approaches.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The simultaneous activation of two or more safety responses (e.g., freeze-flight, fight-fawn), creating unique physiological and psychological experiences that require specific therapeutic approaches. This is particularly relevant for neurodivergent individuals who often experience complex, overlapping regulatory states. #regulatory-models #hybrid-response-states
```

## bidirectional-advocacy

**Suggested definition:**

A mutual approach to self-advocacy in relationships where partners both express their own needs and help remind/support their partner in recognizing and expressing needs, particularly valuable for neurodivergent relationships.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
A mutual approach to self-advocacy in relationships where partners both express their own needs and help remind/support their partner in recognizing and expressing needs, particularly valuable for neurodivergent relationships. This expands traditional self-advocacy models. #communication-approaches #bidirectional-advocacy
```

## neurodivergent-couples

**Suggested definition:**

Partnerships where one or both individuals are neurodivergent, presenting unique relational dynamics that require specific understanding of how different neurotypes interact in intimate relationships.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
Partnerships where one or both individuals are neurodivergent, presenting unique relational dynamics that require specific understanding of how different neurotypes interact in intimate relationships. #systems-perspectives #neurodivergent-couples
```

## values-based-negotiation

**Suggested definition:**

A collaborative approach for neurodivergent relationships that focuses on identifying shared underlying values rather than specific behavioral expectations, allowing different neurological styles to implement the same core values in ways that honor their processing differences.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
A collaborative approach for neurodivergent relationships that focuses on identifying shared underlying values rather than specific behavioral expectations, allowing different neurological styles to implement the same core values in ways that honor their processing differences. This approach moves beyond procedural alignment to focus on what matters most to both partners. #communication-approaches #values-based-negotiation
```

## perspective-complementarity

**Suggested definition:**

The recognition that different neurological processing styles lead to complementary observational strengths (e.g., macro pattern recognition versus micro detail focus), which can be integrated rather than positioned as competing approaches.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The recognition that different neurological processing styles lead to complementary observational strengths (e.g., macro pattern recognition versus micro detail focus), which can be integrated rather than positioned as competing approaches. This is particularly valuable for co-parenting partnerships where different perspectives offer complementary insights. #neurological-frameworks #perspective-complementarity
```

## we-solutions

**Suggested definition:**

A framework for neurodivergent relationship problem-solving that intentionally frames challenges as shared territory requiring mutual accommodation rather than positioning one partner's approach as normative.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
A framework for neurodivergent relationship problem-solving that intentionally frames challenges as shared territory requiring mutual accommodation rather than positioning one partner's approach as normative. This addresses power imbalances that often develop in neurodivergent relationships where one neurological style becomes the standard. #systems-perspectives #we-solutions
```

## self-accommodation

**Suggested definition:**

Strategies for extending the same understanding and accommodations to oneself that one readily provides to others, particularly involving the transfer of insights about neurodivergent needs from children or others to oneself.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
Given the recurring pattern of clients extending understanding to others but not themselves, a dedicated category on self-accommodation would be valuable. This would include techniques for transferring insights about children's needs to oneself, methods for identifying double standards, and practices for developing consistent internal/external support frameworks. #self-accommodation #self-compassion
```

## parent-child-mirroring

**Suggested definition:**

The reciprocal process where parents recognize their own neurodivergent traits in their children, creating therapeutic opportunities for self-understanding and intervention through these parallel recognitions.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The transcript reveals how parenting neurodivergent children creates therapeutic opportunities through mirroring, which deserves systematic framework documentation, including recognition patterns between parent and child traits and intervention possibilities through parental insights about children. #parent-child-mirroring #family-systems
```

## fear-avoidance

**Suggested definition:**

A pattern where fear leads to avoidance behaviors, particularly examining the complex relationship between fear and motivation in neurodivergent individuals and the distinction between interest-based versus fear-based avoidance.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The transcript highlights the complex relationship between fear and motivation in ADHD, which warrants dedicated framework attention, including differentiating between interest-based avoidance and fear-based avoidance and identifying when fear serves protective versus limiting functions. #fear-avoidance #motivation-systems
```

## therapeutic-humor

**Suggested definition:**

The strategic use of humor as a clinical intervention to maintain attention, reduce shame, bypass defenses, and strengthen therapeutic alliance, particularly valuable in neurodivergent therapy contexts.

**Context from framework modifications:**

Context 1:
```
The transcript demonstrates how humor serves as a powerful engagement tool for maintaining attention and reducing shame in ADHD therapy, including strategic use of humor to maintain attention during challenging topics and as a defense-bypassing mechanism. #therapeutic-humor #engagement-strategies
