# Tag Glossary

This document defines the standardized tags used throughout our clinical transcript analysis knowledge base. Please refer to this glossary when tagging new analyses to ensure consistency.

## Using This Glossary

- When tagging transcript analyses, use the most specific tag appropriate for the content
- Tags can be used in YAML front matter or as inline hashtags (e.g., #monotropism)
- For hierarchical tags, use the colon format in YAML front matter (e.g., `neurological:monotropism`)
- When using inline hashtags, prefer the simple tag format (e.g., #monotropism rather than #neurological:monotropism)
- Version numbers (v1, v2, etc.) should be added to tags in the YAML front matter to track conceptual evolution

## Neurological Frameworks

### Simple Tags
- **interest-based-nervous-system**: Describes neurological patterns where attention and motivation are primarily guided by interest rather than external demands.
- **monotropism**: Attention style characterized by intense focus on a single interest or task at a time.
- **combined-neurotype-experience**: The unique neurological experience of individuals with multiple neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism and ADHD together).
- **autistic-inertia**: Difficulty initiating or changing activities, particularly notable during transitions.
- **interoception**: Sense of the internal state of the body, including emotional awareness, hunger, temperature, pain, etc. Fundamental to emotional regulation in neurodivergent individuals and increasingly recognized as a key factor in self-regulation.
- **autistic-burnout**: State of chronic exhaustion, reduced functioning, and increased autism traits following periods of high accommodation demands.
- **executive-function**: Cognitive processes including working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control.
- **cognitive-differences**: Fundamental differences in how information is processed, organized, and recalled in neurodivergent individuals.
- **mental-mapping**: Ways different neurotypes process, remember, and navigate spatial and conceptual information.

### Hierarchical Tags
- **neurological:interest-based-nervous-system**: The hierarchical version of interest-based-nervous-system tag.

## Regulatory Models

### Simple Tags
- **bottom-up-processing**: Neural processing that prioritizes sensory and physiological information over cognitive control.
- **co-regulation**: Process where one person helps another regulate their emotional state.

- **energy-management**: Approaches for understanding and managing limited cognitive and emotional resources in neurodivergent individuals.
- **energy-battery**: Concept that energy capacity can be modified through accommodations rather than simply managed as a finite resource. Includes the idea of "Variable Capacity" where accommodations and adaptations can actually increase overall capacity, not just manage limitations.
- **sensory-processing**: How individuals receive, interpret and respond to sensory information.

## Systems Perspectives

### Simple Tags
- **family-dynamics**: How family relationships and patterns impact neurodivergent individuals and vice versa.
- **educational-impact**: How educational systems and expectations affect neurodivergent individuals.
- **dialectical-understanding**: Framework for understanding seemingly contradictory experiences or tensions.
- **attachment-theory**: How attachment patterns intersect with neurodivergent experiences.
- **post-separation-dynamics**: Therapeutic approaches addressing the unique challenges that arise during separation and divorce processes, including boundary enforcement, communication protocols for co-parenting, managing attachment transitions, and navigating legal/practical barriers.
- **convenience-partner**: A post-separation relational dynamic where one partner continues to expect the emotional labor, availability, and support of a committed partner despite actively pursuing separation or having formally ended the relationship.

### Hierarchical Tags

## Developmental Considerations

### Simple Tags
- **adolescent**: Considerations specific to neurodivergent adolescents.
- **school-age**: Considerations specific to neurodivergent school-age children.
- **adult**: Considerations specific to neurodivergent adults.
- **post-secondary-transition**: Considerations for transitioning to post-secondary education or employment.

### Hierarchical Tags

## Communication Approaches

### Simple Tags
- **three-part-communication**: The communication sequence of Self-Admission, Empathy, Ambition.
- **self-advocacy**: Developing skills to communicate one's needs and obtain appropriate accommodations.
- **neurotype-discrimination**: Discussing experiences of discrimination based on neurological differences.
- **softened-startups**: Communication technique for introducing demands or changes in a way that minimizes autonomy threats.
- **metacommunication**: Communication about communication processes, including gateway prompts, operating system mode identification, and feedback about communication preferences.
- **structured-communication-protocols**: Formalized plans for when, how, and what communication is acceptable between separated partners or in high-conflict relationships, including time boundaries, medium specifications, and content limitations.
- **emergency-exception-criteria**: Clear framework for defining what constitutes an emergency requiring immediate response in co-parenting or other high-boundary relationships, reducing ambiguity and potential for boundary violations.
