# Tag Glossary

This document defines the standardized tags used throughout our clinical transcript analysis knowledge base. Please refer to this glossary when tagging new analyses to ensure consistency.

## Using This Glossary

- When tagging transcript analyses, use the most specific tag appropriate for the content
- Tags can be used in YAML front matter or as inline hashtags (e.g., #monotropism)
- For hierarchical tags, use the colon format in YAML front matter (e.g., `neurological:monotropism`)
- When using inline hashtags, prefer the simple tag format (e.g., #monotropism rather than #neurological:monotropism)
- Version numbers (v1, v2, etc.) should be added to tags in the YAML front matter to track conceptual evolution

## Neurological Frameworks

### Simple Tags
- **interest-based-nervous-system**: Describes neurological patterns where attention and motivation are primarily guided by interest rather than external demands.
- **monotropism**: Attention style characterized by intense focus on a single interest or task at a time.
- **combined-neurotype-experience**: The unique neurological experience of individuals with multiple neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism and ADHD together).
- **autistic-inertia**: Difficulty initiating or changing activities, particularly notable during transitions.
- **interoception**: Sense of the internal state of the body, including emotional awareness, hunger, temperature, pain, etc.
- **autistic-burnout**: State of chronic exhaustion, reduced functioning, and increased autism traits following periods of high accommodation demands.
- **executive-function**: Cognitive processes including working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control.
- **cognitive-differences**: Fundamental differences in how information is processed, organized, and recalled in neurodivergent individuals.
- **mental-mapping**: Ways different neurotypes process, remember, and navigate spatial and conceptual information.

### Hierarchical Tags
- **neurological:interest-based-nervous-system**: The hierarchical version of interest-based-nervous-system tag.
- **neurological:monotropism**: The hierarchical version of monotropism tag.
- **neurological:combined-neurotype**: The hierarchical version of combined-neurotype-experience tag.
- **neurological:autistic-inertia**: The hierarchical version of autistic-inertia tag.
- **neurological:interoception**: The hierarchical version of interoception tag.
- **neurological:mental-mapping**: Refers to the ways different neurotypes process, remember, and navigate spatial and conceptual information.

## Regulatory Models

### Simple Tags
- **bottom-up-processing**: Neural processing that prioritizes sensory and physiological information over cognitive control.
- **co-regulation**: Process where one person helps another regulate their emotional state.
- **dysregulation-cascade**: The escalation of emotional and physiological dysregulation that can occur in neurodivergent individuals.
- **energy-management**: Approaches for understanding and managing limited cognitive and emotional resources in neurodivergent individuals.
- **energy-battery**: Concept that energy capacity can be modified through accommodations rather than simply managed as a finite resource.
- **sensory-processing**: How individuals receive, interpret and respond to sensory information.

### Hierarchical Tags
- **regulatory:bottom-up-processing**: The hierarchical version of bottom-up-processing tag.
- **regulatory:co-regulation**: The hierarchical version of co-regulation tag.
- **regulatory:dysregulation-cascade**: The hierarchical version of dysregulation-cascade tag.
- **regulatory:energy-management**: The hierarchical version of energy-management tag.
- **regulatory:energy-battery**: The hierarchical version of energy-battery tag.
- **regulatory:sensory-processing**: The hierarchical version of sensory-processing tag.

## Systems Perspectives

### Simple Tags
- **family-dynamics**: How family relationships and patterns impact neurodivergent individuals and vice versa.
- **educational-impact**: How educational systems and expectations affect neurodivergent individuals.
- **dialectical-understanding**: Framework for understanding seemingly contradictory experiences or tensions.
- **attachment-theory**: How attachment patterns intersect with neurodivergent experiences.

### Hierarchical Tags
- **systems:family-dynamics**: The hierarchical version of family-dynamics tag.
- **systems:educational-impact**: The hierarchical version of educational-impact tag.
- **systems:dialectical-understanding**: The hierarchical version of dialectical-understanding tag.
- **systems:attachment-theory**: The hierarchical version of attachment-theory tag.

## Developmental Considerations

### Simple Tags
- **adolescent**: Considerations specific to neurodivergent adolescents.
- **school-age**: Considerations specific to neurodivergent school-age children.
- **adult**: Considerations specific to neurodivergent adults.
- **post-secondary-transition**: Considerations for transitioning to post-secondary education or employment.

### Hierarchical Tags
- **developmental:adolescent**: The hierarchical version of adolescent tag.
- **developmental:school-age**: The hierarchical version of school-age tag.
- **developmental:adult**: The hierarchical version of adult tag.
- **developmental:post-secondary**: The hierarchical version of post-secondary-transition tag.

## Communication Approaches

### Simple Tags
- **three-part-communication**: The communication sequence of Self-Admission, Empathy, Ambition.
- **self-advocacy**: Developing skills to communicate one's needs and obtain appropriate accommodations.
- **neurotype-discrimination**: Discussing experiences of discrimination based on neurological differences.
- **softened-startups**: Communication technique for introducing demands or changes in a way that minimizes autonomy threats.

### Hierarchical Tags
- **communication:three-part-sequence**: The hierarchical version of three-part-communication tag.
- **communication:self-advocacy**: The hierarchical version of self-advocacy tag.
- **communication:softened-startups**: The hierarchical version of softened-startups tag.
