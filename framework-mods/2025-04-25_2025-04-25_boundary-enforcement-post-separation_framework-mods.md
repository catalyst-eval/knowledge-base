# Framework Modification Recommendations

*Extracted from: Boundary Enforcement During Divorce Process*

### Add "Post-Separation Dynamics" as a Conceptual Category

Given the complexity of therapeutic support during separation and divorce processes, having a framework section dedicated to post-separation dynamics would be valuable. This would include:
- Boundary enforcement strategies
- Communication protocols for co-parenting
- Managing attachment transitions
- Legal/practical barrier identification
