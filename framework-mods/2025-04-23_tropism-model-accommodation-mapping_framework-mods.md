# Framework Modifications for Tropism Model and Combined Neurotype

Based on the transcript analyses of sessions focused on tropism models, accommodation mapping, and combined neurotype experiences, the following additions and modifications to our clinical framework are recommended:

## New Tags to Add

### 1. variotropism
**Proposed Definition**: An attention pattern characterized by scattered, inconsistent focus that shifts based on novelty and stimulation demands, primarily associated with ADHD neurotype but distinct from polytropic attention.

**Justification**: The tropism model discussed in both analyzed transcripts introduces variotropism as a specific pattern distinct from both monotropism (intense single focus) and polytropic attention. This concept helps differentiate ADHD attention patterns from both autistic and neurotypical attention allocation and provides a more nuanced understanding beyond simply "distractible."

**Tag Category**: Neurological Frameworks

**Related Tags**: monotropism, combined-neurotype-experience, interest-based-nervous-system

### 2. tropism-attachment-matrix
**Proposed Definition**: An integrated framework that maps how attention styles (monotropism, polytropic, variotropic) interact with attachment patterns, providing insight into relational dynamics for neurodivergent individuals.

**Justification**: From the combined neurotype analysis: "The therapist introduces a visual matrix that combines monotropism/polytropic/variotropic attention styles with attachment styles, representing an innovative integration of neurological frameworks with relational models." This concept extends beyond typical monotropism theory by explicitly connecting attention patterns to relational dynamics.

**Tag Category**: Systems Perspectives

**Related Tags**: monotropism, attachment-theory, combined-neurotype-experience

### 3. accommodation-mapping
**Proposed Definition**: A structured approach to documenting and implementing neurodivergent accommodations across different environments, with emphasis on identifying energy expenditure and developing targeted supports.

**Justification**: Both transcript analyses demonstrate a methodical approach to identifying and implementing accommodations based on energy expenditure and neurotype-specific needs. This approach moves beyond ad-hoc accommodations to a systematic mapping across contexts.

**Tag Category**: Practical Strategies

**Related Tags**: self-advocacy, energy-management, partial-accommodation

## Expanded Conceptualizations

### 1. tropism-model
**Current Definition**: Botanical metaphor applied to attention styles (monotropism, polytropic).

**Proposed Expansion**: The tropism model should be expanded to include varotropism as a distinct attention style, and to incorporate how these attention patterns interact with regulation, transitions, and relational dynamics. The model serves as an integrative framework for understanding neurodivergent attention beyond simple categorization.

**Justification**: Both transcripts demonstrate a more sophisticated application of the tropism model than initially captured, showing how it connects to multiple domains of functioning including transitions, sensory processing, and interpersonal relationships.

### 2. combined-neurotype-experience
**Current Definition**: The unique neurological experience of individuals with multiple neurodevelopmental conditions.

**Proposed Expansion**: The concept should be expanded to explicitly address how autism and ADHD interact in terms of attention allocation (monotropic vs. varotropic), regulation needs, and transition challenges. The combined experience creates specific patterns that are distinct from either condition alone.

**Justification**: The transcripts highlight specific ways autism and ADHD interact beyond simple addition of traits, including the tropism-attachment matrix and the unique challenges in energy management when both conditions are present.

## Conceptual Relationships to Emphasize

### 1. Tropism Model & Transition Management
The transcripts demonstrate how different attention styles directly impact transition difficulties, with monotropic patterns creating distinct challenges compared to varotropic patterns. Understanding these differences affects accommodation strategies - monotropic attention may require longer preparation and "ramping down" of focus, while varotropic attention may require structured redirection and novelty management.

### 2. Combined Neurotype & Energy Management
The combination of autism and ADHD creates unique challenges for energy management that go beyond either condition individually. The varotropic attention of ADHD can deplete energy through constant shifting, while the monotropic attention of autism requires significant energy for transitions. This interaction should be emphasized in our framework to help clinicians better understand how to support clients with both conditions.

### 3. Accommodation Mapping & Self-Advocacy
The accommodation mapping approach provides a structured foundation for self-advocacy, as it develops language and awareness around specific needs. This relationship between mapping and advocacy should be emphasized in our framework to show how systematic documentation of needs supports more effective communication about accommodations.

## Conclusion

These proposed modifications would enhance our clinical framework by providing more nuanced understanding of attention patterns (varotropism), integrated conceptual models (tropism-attachment matrix), and practical approaches to accommodation (accommodation mapping). The expanded conceptualizations and emphasized relationships would also strengthen the coherence of our overall framework, particularly in supporting individuals with combined neurotypes.
