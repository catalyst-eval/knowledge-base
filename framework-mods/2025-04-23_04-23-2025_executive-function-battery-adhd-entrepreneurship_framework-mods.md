# Framework Modification Recommendations

*Extracted from: Executive Function Battery Management in ADHD Entrepreneurship: Energy Allocation and Value-Based Decision Making*

### Add "ADHD Entrepreneurship" to Client-Centered Applications

Given the prevalence of entrepreneurship among individuals with ADHD and the unique challenges and strengths they bring to business ownership, a dedicated category would be valuable. This would include:
- Executive function allocation strategies for business owners
- Interest-based business development approaches
- Delegation frameworks that complement ADHD strengths and challenges
- Communication strategies for client and employee interactions
