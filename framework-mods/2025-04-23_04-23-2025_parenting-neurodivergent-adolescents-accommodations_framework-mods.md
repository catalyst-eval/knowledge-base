# Framework Modification Recommendations

*Extracted from: Parenting Neurodivergent Adolescents: Collaborative Accommodations and Family Communication*

### Add "Neurodivergent Parenting" to Client-Centered Applications

Given the prevalence of neurodivergent parents raising neurodivergent children, a dedicated category would be valuable. This would include:
- Accommodations for executive function challenges in parenting
- Communication strategies across different processing styles
- Self-regulation supports for parents during child dysregulation
- Intergenerational pattern recognition and modification
