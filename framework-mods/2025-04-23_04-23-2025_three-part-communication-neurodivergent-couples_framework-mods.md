# Framework Modification Recommendations

*Extracted from: Three-Part Communication in Neurodivergent Couples: Self-Admission, Empathy, and Ambition*

### Add "Metacommunication" to Communication Approaches

Given the emphasis on communicating about communication processes, a dedicated category on metacommunication would be valuable. This would include:
- Gateway prompts to signal cognitive states
- Operating system mode identification
- Process-focused feedback loops
- Communication about communication preferences
