# Framework Modification Recommendations

*Extracted from: Fear, Motivation, and Self-Accommodation in Neurodivergent Adult Therapy*

### Add "Self-Accommodation" to Practical Strategies

Given the recurring pattern of clients extending understanding to others but not themselves, a dedicated category on self-accommodation would be valuable. This would include:
- Techniques for transferring insights about children's needs to oneself
- Methods for identifying double standards in self-treatment versus others
- Practices for developing consistent internal/external support frameworks
- Language for reframing self-criticism through a neurodiversity lens

### Expand "Dialectical Understanding" to Include Neurodivergent-Specific Dialectics

The framework would benefit from explicitly identifying dialectical tensions that are particularly salient for neurodivergent individuals:
- Autonomy/Avoidance - The tension between self-determination and fear
- Interest/Importance - The gap between interest-based motivation and societal expectations
- Authenticity/Adaptation - The balance between true self-expression and necessary adjustments

### Add "Parent-Child Mirroring" to Systems Perspectives

The transcript reveals how parenting neurodivergent children creates therapeutic opportunities through mirroring, which deserves systematic framework documentation:
- Recognition patterns between parent and child traits
- Intervention possibilities through parental insights about children
- Transfer techniques for extending child-directed accommodations to self
- Methods for breaking intergenerational patterns

### Create "Fear-Motivation Relationship" Under Regulatory Models

The transcript highlights the complex relationship between fear and motivation in ADHD, which warrants dedicated framework attention:
- Differentiating between interest-based avoidance and fear-based avoidance
- Identifying when fear serves protective versus limiting functions
- Developing graduated exposure approaches for interest-based nervous systems
- Reframing avoidance as information rather than failure

### Add "Humor as Engagement Strategy" to Communication Approaches

The transcript demonstrates how humor serves as a powerful engagement tool for maintaining attention and reducing shame in ADHD therapy:
- Strategic use of humor to maintain attention during challenging topics
- Humor as a defense-bypassing mechanism
- Therapeutic relationship building through shared humor
- Balance between humor and therapeutic seriousness
