# Tropism Model and Accommodation Mapping in Neurodivergent Therapy

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents a therapy session between a therapist (Speaker A) and a client (Speaker B) who appears to have a combined autism-ADHD neurotype. The session focuses on introducing theoretical frameworks for understanding attention systems and practical approaches to managing burnout. The therapist demonstrates a #neurodiversity-affirming approach by:

1. Using a detailed visual model (tropism/lighthouse metaphor) to explain attention patterns
2. Discussing neurotype-specific experiences without pathologizing language
3. Introducing accommodation mapping as a client-centered approach to energy management
4. Acknowledging the interplay between trauma history and neurodivergent experiences
5. Framing burnout as energy depletion rather than depression or character flaws

The session uses a combination of psychoeducation and collaborative exploration, setting up a structured approach to help the client understand their neurological experiences while developing practical accommodations.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Tropism Model with Attachment Style Integration

The therapist presents an innovative framework that integrates attention patterns with attachment styles:

Speaker A: "This is where I'm crossing attention, this whole attention tropism thing and attachment style. You and I would have talked about the fact that attachment isn't normed for neurodivergence yet. This is me taking a stab at it."

This framework expands standard conceptual models by explicitly connecting how different attention patterns (monotropism, polytropisim, varotropism) might interact with attachment patterns, creating a more nuanced understanding of relational experiences in neurodivergent individuals. The therapist suggests that intense focus in relationships might be misinterpreted as anxious attachment when it's actually normative for monotropic attention styles. #tropism-attachment-matrix #attachment-theory

### Varotropism as ADHD Attentional Pattern

The therapist introduces a novel term for describing ADHD attention patterns:

Speaker A: "This is not in the science yet. I've coined the term varotropism more or less meaning that it varies, that it's more variable, meaning that it's more likely that an ADHD would flip from mono to poly back and forth."

This concept extends beyond traditional understandings of ADHD attention as primarily distractible, suggesting instead a pattern of variable but intense attention that moves between hyper-focus and diffuse awareness. This framing positions ADHD attention as a different pattern rather than a deficit. #varotropism #adhd-attention

## Quotes Illustrating Key Principles

### On Combined Autism-ADHD Experience

Speaker A: "When people have mixed neurology sets where between 30 and 80% of autistic individuals are also ADHD and ADHDers experience 30 to 80% of autistic identified traits... The diagnostics haven't caught up with the real dynamic."

Speaker A: "If there is going to be a fourth column that I add it's going to be the AuDHD one... It is its own phenotype. AuDHD. It's a distinct one."

These exchanges demonstrate the therapist's conceptualization of combined autism-ADHD as its own distinct neurotype rather than simply a combination of two separate conditions, emphasizing the unique lived experience that isn't captured by current diagnostic frameworks. #combined-neurotype #diagnostic-limitations

### On Neurodivergent Burnout

Speaker A: "Autistic burnout is different than depression. Autistic burnout is going to be less like the mood experience and more like 'I don't have any battery' where people will go 'what's wrong with you? Are you depressed?' Here's an antidepressant and you take the antidepressant. It actually can work at cross purposes."

This illustrates the distinct nature of autistic burnout as energy depletion rather than emotional depression, highlighting how misidentification can lead to inappropriate treatments that may exacerbate rather than alleviate difficulties. #autistic-burnout #misdiagnosis

### On Community Accommodation Models

Speaker A: "This is why wolves have the most frail of their pack up at the front... they make sure that they account for and accommodate... It's a community viewpoint on differences in physiology or physical ability... We just seem to be kind of thumbing our nose fairly frequently at it."

This demonstrates the therapist's use of natural accommodation models to illustrate how communities can support neurodivergent members, drawing on biological examples to normalize accommodation rather than portraying it as exceptional or burdensome. #accommodation-models #community-support

### On Relational Patterns and Neurodivergent Experiences

Speaker A: "From a relationship standpoint, autistic and ADHD individuals are more likely to experience relationship trauma. It's because of the intensity of the light and the challenge at times in moving the light based on interest. Right? That's where oftentimes autistic and ADHD individuals will describe falling for someone too easily... and then missing certain warning signs."

This illustrates how neurodivergent attention patterns can create vulnerability in relationships, while acknowledging this as a neurological difference rather than a personal failing. #relationship-patterns #neurotype-vulnerability

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Monotropism Theory

The therapist's use of the tropism model builds directly on the monotropism theory proposed by Murray, Lesser, and Lawson (2005), which conceptualizes autism as a difference in attention allocation rather than a social deficit. Recent work by Crompton et al. (2020) has provided empirical support for this framework, showing that autistic individuals navigate social interaction differently but effectively with other autistic individuals. The therapist's extension of this model to include varotropism for ADHD represents an innovative development that aligns with emerging research on variable cognitive engagement in ADHD (Kofler et al., 2022). #monotropism #attention-allocation

### Combined Autism-ADHD Phenotype

The therapist's description of AuDHD as a distinct phenotype reflects emerging research on the co-occurrence of autism and ADHD. Studies by Antshel and Russo (2019) found that 30-80% of individuals with one condition display traits of the other, with unique profiles of executive function, sensory processing, and social communication. Recent work by Supekar et al. (2022) using neuroimaging has identified distinct neural signatures in individuals with combined presentations, supporting the therapist's conceptualization of AuDHD as its own phenotype rather than simply comorbidity. #combined-phenotype #neurodevelopmental-overlap

### Burnout and Pacing Systems

The discussion of burnout and energy management connects to research on autistic burnout by Raymaker et al. (2020), which identified it as a phenomenon distinct from depression characterized by exhaustion, increased autism traits, and reduced functioning following periods of high demand. The therapist's approach to accommodation mapping aligns with recent work by Mantzalas et al. (2023) on pacing strategies for neurodivergent individuals, which emphasizes the importance of transition management and decision support in preventing burnout. #burnout-prevention #pacing-strategies

### Attachment in Neurodivergent Individuals

The therapist's integration of attachment theory with attention patterns addresses a significant gap in current literature. While traditional attachment models weren't developed with neurodivergent populations in mind, recent work by Gallitto and Leth-Steensen (2019) has begun to explore how attachment manifests differently in ADHD, and studies by Tavassoli et al. (2022) have examined unique attachment patterns in autism. The therapist's matrix represents an innovative attempt to systematize these emerging findings. #attachment-neurodiversity #relationship-patterns
