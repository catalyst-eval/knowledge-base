# Safety System Framework for Neurodivergent Couples: Trauma Response Patterns and Recovery

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents an initial therapy session between a clinician (Speaker A) and a couple (Speaker B, referred to as "Ricky" and "Mary"). The session establishes a #neurodiversity-affirming approach to couples therapy that integrates trauma-informed care and neurodivergent-specific considerations. The therapist introduces a robust conceptual framework for understanding safety and response patterns (the "Four F's": Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn) and their corresponding recovery states, with particular attention to how these manifest in the context of neurodivergence. Key issues addressed include communication challenges, intimacy concerns, complex medication management, substance use recovery, parenting stress with four children, and potential combined neurotype dynamics (ADHD with suspected autism and PTSD).

The therapist employs a notable visual framework tool that depersonalizes behavior patterns by framing them as safety mechanisms rather than personality traits or character flaws. This approach appears particularly valuable for reducing shame and blame in the relationship, especially where neurodivergent traits and trauma histories may be interacting. The session demonstrates how neurodiversity-affirming couples work can incorporate trauma-informed models to help partners better understand themselves and each other.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Safety System Framework

The therapist introduces a reframing of "trauma personalities" into a universal "safety system framework" that applies to all humans regardless of trauma history:

Speaker A: "The original author calls these trauma personalities. The reason I don't call them trauma personalities is because it is our safety system. We all have it. We don't all necessarily have trauma."

This represents an important evolution in how neurobiological safety mechanisms are conceptualized, removing the stigma of trauma-specific language while acknowledging that these patterns become problematic when "off or on too long." This creates a more inclusive approach that can address both trauma backgrounds and neurodivergent regulation patterns. #safety-system #trauma-response-patterns

### Hybrid Response States

The clinician introduces the concept of hybrid safety states, where two response patterns activate simultaneously:

Speaker A: "Typically we experience all of these and you can experience two at once... When somebody is in freeze and flight at the same time, I call it hide and seek... if you're hidden and you hear somebody getting close, what's that feeling like you're breathing less and your heart rate's picking up. That's a hybrid state."

This nuanced understanding of safety responses extends beyond traditional models that treat these states as discrete categories, providing a more accurate representation of complex neurobiological responses in neurodivergent individuals. #hybrid-response-states #neurodivergent-regulation

### Recovery-Focused Framing

The therapist presents a unique "recovery matrix" that pairs each safety response pattern with its specific recovery counterpart:

Speaker A: "So recovery is... Now I want to try. Now I'll give this a shot. These kind end up freeze. If you remember, the negative version of it is I'm safe if I hide. This is about exploring... It's not going from the back of the cave... All of a sudden ripping all your clothes off and going streaking out the front. It's like turning on a little pen light and exploring a little further out."

This innovation promotes a gradual, self-compassionate approach to changing entrenched patterns, especially valuable for neurodivergent individuals who may experience more intense safety responses. #recovery-mechanisms #neurodivergent-couples

### Bidirectional Self-Advocacy

The clinician introduces a concept of "self-advocacy goes both ways," expanding traditional self-advocacy models:

Speaker A: "Self advocacy goes both ways. Meaning like you could say, hey, I've learned that it helps me when if I'm feeling this way, you are able to respond this way. Or it helps me when I do this when I'm shut down. But it's hard for me to remember that. And then that person finds themselves shut down and the partner is able to say to them, hey, remember, what helps you is self advocacy going both directions."

This mutual approach to advocacy is particularly relevant for neurodivergent couples where both partners may have different support needs and communication styles. #bidirectional-advocacy #communication-approaches

## Metaphors and Explanatory Tools Used

### Four F's Framework

The most central metaphorical framework presented is the Four F's model of safety responses (Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn), which the therapist visually displays and thoroughly explains:

Speaker A: "Freeze is I'm safe if I hide. This is the back of the cave... Flight is I'm safe if I'm perfect or achieving or I understand really close to perfectly... Fawn is I'm safe if the other person is happy... Fight is I'm safe if I'm in control."

This accessible metaphorical system provides a non-stigmatizing language for partners to discuss challenging patterns without triggering defensiveness. It appears particularly suited to supporting neurodivergent individuals who may benefit from concrete, visual frameworks. #four-f-framework #safety-system

### Recovery Matrix

The complementary recovery framework offers paired metaphors for each safety response:

- From Freeze ("I'm safe if I hide") to Explore ("I can turn on a pen light and explore")
- From Flight ("I'm safe if I'm perfect") to Relax ("I can lay on the couch and eat my favorite food")
- From Fawn ("I'm safe if you're happy") to Self-Advocate ("I can ask for my needs to be met")
- From Fight ("I'm safe if I'm in control") to Grieve ("I can grieve the loss of control I didn't choose")

This comprehensive metaphorical system offers concrete pathways from protective to healing states, which appears especially valuable for concrete thinkers. #recovery-matrix #regulation-strategies

### Hide and Seek 

The therapist introduces the "hide and seek" metaphor to illustrate hybrid states:

Speaker A: "When somebody is in freeze and flight at the same time, I call it hide and seek. I don't know the last time you guys played hide and seek, but if you're hidden and you hear somebody getting close, what's that feeling like you're breathing less and your heart rate's picking up. That's a hybrid state."

This child's game metaphor effectively communicates the physiological experience of simultaneous activation of two safety systems in a relatable way. #hide-and-seek #hybrid-response-states

## Client-Centered Applications

### Neurodivergent Couples Communication

The framework provides specific applications for neurodivergent couples' communication:

Speaker A: "Is it would be fair for one of you to go, I feel like I'm kind of stuck in the freeze mode a little bit right now. And your partner is not going to hear that. It as like, you jerk. There you go again, just avoiding me. We view it as, okay, this is like what's happening is. Then we go, okay, what helps somebody not be in a freeze state?"

This depersonalized communication approach directly addresses the common challenge of partners interpreting neurodivergent regulation needs or trauma responses as intentional behavior. #neurodivergent-couples #communication-approaches

### Substance Recovery and Neurodivergence

The therapist specifically addresses the intersection of substance recovery and neurodivergent traits, acknowledging the complex interplay between medication management, sobriety, and neurological factors:

Speaker A: "What was the substance of choice?... It's not me saying that it's unimportant or that it's not a need. It's more this idea of hey, we're trying to move forward on multiple fronts all at the same time. It's not going to be a singular thing or a pill or anything like that... Ricky, just take one more pill'be all right."

This approach acknowledges the complexity of recovery in the context of neurodivergence, avoiding simplistic solutions while validating the multi-faceted challenges. #substance-recovery-neurodivergence #medication-management

### Parenting with Neurodivergence

The session addresses the specific challenges of neurodivergent parenting with multiple children (four, including a toddler):

Speaker A: "You guys got four kids, right? Jez? Okay, talk to me about what you guys are managing day to day."

By placing parenting challenges within the context of neurodivergence and the safety framework, the therapist offers a pathway to reduce parental shame and increase understanding of how stress responses may be activated in parenting contexts. #neurodivergent-parenting #parenting-stress

### Intimacy in Neurodivergent Relationships

The therapist addresses intimacy challenges through the lens of multiple interacting factors rather than assigning blame:

Speaker A: "In this case, right past traumas, neurodivergents, substances, physical health, mental health, all of that is interrelated. So it just means that what I would coach you guys up on having to do with physical intimacy and so on is to work towards depersonalising it, at least for now, from the standpoint of whether it's having to do with Mary, whether it's something you've done or Ricky, whether it's something that you've done..."

This approach recognizes how neurodivergent traits, trauma histories, and relationship dynamics can create complex intimacy challenges that require depersonalized problem-solving. #neurodivergent-intimacy #depersonalizing-challenges

## Practical Strategies Demonstrated

### Pattern Recognition Through Visual Frameworks

The therapist provides visual frameworks for understanding safety responses and recovery pathways:

Speaker A: "Let me share the recovery graphic... So recovery is... You'll notice the language changes from I'm safe from trauma and pain. If what I do is. But now we're saying I'm safe from trauma, pain... So now I can. Now I want to try. Now I'll give this a shot."

This visual approach offers concrete tools for clients to identify patterns in themselves and their partners, particularly helpful for visual thinkers and those who benefit from external processing aids. #pattern-recognition #visual-frameworks

### Depersonalizing Relationship Challenges

The clinician consistently reframes challenges as shared problems rather than personal failings:

Speaker A: "Well, y'all are here though, so like that's part of... That's what I call an unsolved problem where it's like, it's not a Ricky problem, it's not a Mary problem. It's just a problem. It's an unsolved one."

This depersonalization strategy helps reduce blame and defensiveness, creating space for collaborative problem-solving. #depersonalizing-challenges #collaborative-problem-solving

### Medication Integration with Therapy

The therapist acknowledges the role of medication management while integrating it with therapeutic approaches:

Speaker A: "And are these all prescribed through the same doctor, or is it like... I mean, I can see why you've been tired. And obviously it's anecdotal experience. I do have training in psychopharmacology, but not from the standpoint of prescribing and so on."

This integrated approach respects the multimodal needs of neurodivergent clients while avoiding over-simplifying complex challenges. #medication-integration #multimodal-support

### Collaborative Homework Development

The clinician assigns personalized homework that accommodates differing processing styles:

Speaker A: "When I send this to you guys, kind of his homework for both Mary, you and Ricky is to is you guys collaborate and go, hey, this information would be easier for Ricky's digestion if it's important to me."

This accommodation-focused approach to between-session work demonstrates respect for differing neurological processing styles. #collaborative-homework #processing-accommodations

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Polyvagal Theory and Safety Systems

The Four F's framework presented is consistent with Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 2011), which emphasizes the neurobiological basis of safety responses. Research has shown that neurodivergent individuals often show atypical autonomic nervous system functioning (Bellato et al., 2020), making safety-based frameworks particularly relevant. The therapist's approach aligns with current understanding that these responses are neurobiologically-based rather than character flaws. #polyvagal-theory #neurodivergent-regulation

### Trauma-Informed Neurodiversity-Affirming Approaches

The integration of trauma-informed and neurodiversity-affirming approaches exemplified in this session reflects emerging best practices in treating neurodivergent clients with trauma histories. Research by Haruvi-Lamdan et al. (2020) indicates that autistic individuals may be more vulnerable to developing PTSD and that trauma symptoms may manifest differently in neurodivergent populations. The therapist's framework acknowledges these intersections. #trauma-informed-practice #neurodiversity-affirming

### Couple Therapy for Neurodivergent Partners

While research on evidence-based approaches for neurodivergent couples remains limited, this session demonstrates alignment with recommendations from Finkenauer et al. (2022) who suggest that interventions for neurodiverse couples should focus on depersonalizing differences, developing shared language, and implementing specific communication supports. The safety framework provides exactly these elements. #neurodivergent-couples #evidence-based-practice

### Substance Recovery in Neurodivergent Populations

The therapist's nuanced approach to substance recovery in the context of neurodivergence aligns with emerging research indicating that neurodivergent individuals may have unique recovery needs. Studies by Kronenberg et al. (2015) suggest that standard substance use treatment programs may not adequately address the needs of individuals with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions, supporting the integrated approach demonstrated in this session. #substance-recovery-neurodivergence #adhd-recovery

This analysis demonstrates the strong alignment between the therapeutic approach presented in the transcript and current evidence-based, neurodiversity-affirming practices for couples therapy. The integration of trauma-informed frameworks with neurodiversity considerations provides a valuable model for supporting neurodivergent couples with complex needs.
