# Double Empathy in Neurodivergent Parenting Couples: Values-Based Accommodation Approaches

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents a therapy session between a clinician (Speaker B) and a couple (identified as Amanda and Daniel) who are navigating complex communication challenges at the intersection of #neurodivergent-couples dynamics and parenting conflicts. The session focuses on a recent incident where differing parenting approaches to managing sibling conflict during video game play highlighted deeper communication patterns and understanding gaps between the partners.

The therapist facilitates a #neurodiversity-affirming approach that acknowledges the fundamental #double-empathy-problem between the partners - a mutual difficulty in understanding each other's perspectives based on neurological differences. Rather than positioning one partner's approach as correct, the therapist reframes the challenge as finding "we solutions" that accommodate both partners' neurological styles while establishing shared parenting values.

Key insights include how different neurological processing affects parenting observations (with one partner noticing macro patterns and the other focusing on micro details), how repeated communication breakdowns can lead to frustration and withdrawal, and how scheduled values discussions can create structured opportunities for understanding without requiring spontaneous recognition of emotional cues. The session provides a practical framework for couples to navigate the complex terrain of neurodivergent communication while co-parenting effectively.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Double Empathy in Intimate Partnership

The therapist applies the "double empathy problem" concept to intimate partnership dynamics rather than its usual application to autistic/non-autistic social interactions:

Speaker A (Amanda): "In our double empathy problem, I feel like my only solution is for me to just... I can see his side, just accept it and accept that he's never going to see my side. That's the only solution to move forward."

Speaker B (Therapist): "Both of you are stating more or less the same thing, where both of you feel like you can't come to one another intensely and be heard."

This application extends theoretical understanding by demonstrating how the double empathy problem manifests in long-term relationships where partners are consistently trying but failing to understand each other's neurological experiences. #double-empathy-problem #neurodivergent-couples

### Values-Based Negotiation in Neurodivergent Co-Parenting

The therapist introduces a novel framework for managing neurodivergent parenting differences through values-based negotiation rather than procedural alignment:

Speaker B: "What I would want the 'we parenting' portion of it to be is you guys engaging on, 'hey, what do we want our values to be?' When the kids are playing Smash Brothers, shutting down all conflict between them is bad, but letting it go on too long is bad, then that's when you have the value conversation there."

This shifts the focus from specific behavioral expectations ("you should have noticed and intervened") to shared underlying values that can be implemented differently based on each parent's neurological style. #values-based-negotiation #neurodivergent-parenting

### Macro/Micro Perspective Complementarity

The therapist reframes different parenting focuses as complementary macro and micro perspectives rather than one being right and the other wrong:

Speaker B: "You're going to notice the macro. That's what you described in terms of the routine that you were doing. I saw the macro of how... you saw that macro value there and were trying to maintain that. And [she's] on the micro details standpoint."

This perspective-complementarity concept offers a new framework for understanding how parents with different neurological profiles might observe and prioritize different aspects of the same parenting situation. #macro-micro-perspectives #neurological-frameworks

### Scheduled Values Discussion Approach

The therapist proposes a structured, time-limited approach to discussing parenting values as an accommodation for executive functioning differences:

Speaker B: "Set a timer you can negotiate on the amount of time... be intentional about scheduling when you do talk about it, but give it a couple days... focusing on just this on the value side, 30 minutes max."

This represents an evolution beyond typical couples communication advice by building in specific accommodations for executive functioning challenges, working memory differences, and emotional regulation needs. #scheduled-values-discussion #communication-approaches

## Metaphors and Explanatory Tools Used

### "We Solutions" Framework

The therapist employs a "we solutions" metaphor as a central framing device for couples collaboration:

Speaker B: "That's kind of like one of those ideas of the... like, the 'we'... the 'we solutions'. Can we discuss the parenting things together earlier?"

This metaphor effectively shifts the narrative from "your problem" vs. "my problem" to shared problem-solving, particularly valuable for neurodivergent couples who may otherwise fall into blame patterns based on neurological differences. #we-solutions #bidirectional-advocacy

### Cooking Metaphor for Pattern Recognition

Amanda uses a cooking metaphor to explain her frustration with repeated patterns:

Speaker A: "The example I put for like the frustration over with the kids is like putting a pot of full up to the tippy top on the stove, turn up the heat all the way and see that it bubbles over and it makes a mess and you got to clean it up great. Yes, clean up the mess. But then you also have to learn from it."

This concrete metaphor effectively communicates the emotional labor involved in constantly managing the same preventable situations. #pattern-identification #metaphorical-communication

### "Catbird Seat" vs. "Ravine of Deep Emotion"

The therapist uses a spatial metaphor to distinguish between being in the middle of parenting challenges versus observing them:

Speaker B: "When one parent is in... in the catbird seat interacting with all the boys and the other parent has to intuit something or has a feeling, how do we do it? That keeps us both with the ravine of deep emotion in mind. How do we do it in a way that we stay behind the fence up at the top?"

This visualizes the challenge of maintaining perspective when emotionally activated versus observing a situation from a distance. #emotional-regulation #perspective-taking

### Parenting Values Meeting as a Tool

The therapist introduces a "parenting values meeting" metaphor while acknowledging the potential resistance to this approach:

Speaker B: "I know that the last thing you want is another thing scheduled. But... what's not established for you guys is just kind of on this, like, value side..."

This presents a practical structure while validating the cognitive load this might represent, particularly for the neurodivergent partner. #parenting-values-meeting #practical-strategies

## Client-Centered Applications

### Neurodivergent Couples Communication

The session demonstrates specific applications for neurodivergent couples communication:

Speaker A (Amanda): "Just feels like it comes back to, I could have brought questions out. I could have done this. It's always on me having more communication and more communication."

Speaker B (Therapist): "I'm not saying that you've got to do more, though."

Speaker A: "That's what I hear from him, though. It's like, 'well, why can't you just tell me?'"

The therapist reframes this common dynamic by emphasizing that both partners need to make accommodations rather than placing all accommodation responsibility on one partner. This represents a significant evolution in neurodivergent couples therapy approaches. #neurodivergent-couples #bidirectional-advocacy

### Neurodivergent Parenting Teams

The session addresses how neurodivergent parenting teams can navigate different observation patterns:

Speaker A (Daniel): "I am trying to balance this with, like, it's... it's a very rare thing that Sebastian will want to do anything with his youngest brother. And to me, it's like, it's... he's coming to the table willingly and wanting to do this thing, and it's not perfect."

Speaker A (Amanda): "When he starts going, how, how are... and you can hear it in his voice, he's heading towards name calling and just getting in his brother's face and sometimes even have to worry about I need to physically step between them."

The therapist validates both perspectives while emphasizing complementary strengths rather than positioning one approach as superior. #neurodivergent-parenting #collaborative-parenting

### Monotropism Recognition and Accommodation

The transcript explicitly addresses monotropism as a contributing factor:

Speaker A (Amanda): "Pull out of the monotropism and... And see the rest of us in this. And not just that it hurts your feelings and feel sucky to have me yelling at you."

The therapist acknowledges how monotropic focus can affect parenting observations and offers strategies that accommodate for this neurological difference without pathologizing it. #monotropism #neurological-frameworks

### Emotional Patterning Recognition

The session provides concrete approaches for recognizing emotional patterns in family dynamics:

Speaker A (Amanda): "I get so tired of reining myself in just all the time, and it's like, I have to say everything in a nice, calm manner. Or all he hears as 'she's mad at me'."

Speaker B (Therapist): "We are personally responsible for how we're triggered. It cannot be... It can't be an inference. And it doesn't matter how repetitive or how frequently something has happened. There's not a 'you should have known'."

This approach offers practical guidance for managing emotional escalation patterns in neurodivergent family systems. #emotional-patterning #regulation-strategies

## Practical Strategies Demonstrated

### Time-Limited Values Discussion

The therapist offers a concrete, structured approach to discussing parenting values that accommodates executive functioning differences:

Speaker B: "Is you literally sat here with one. You guys have watched me do enough of these where you could probably... I was... Well, you could. You could twot waffle around with this and probably figure out something that's resonating with y'all from the parenting standpoint..."

This strategy provides a clear, time-limited framework that reduces cognitive load while increasing the possibility of productive conversation. #values-discussion #executive-function-accommodations

### Depersonalizing Trigger Patterns

The therapist demonstrates depersonalizing conflict patterns:

Speaker B: "What did you guys talk about in session today? Well, the phrase Smash brothers used 12 times, they like, okay, cool, whatever. Right. There are weird things that end up being a good case." 

This approach helps remove blame while focusing on observable patterns, making it easier for both partners to engage without defensiveness. #depersonalizing-conflict #pattern-identification

### Perspective Bridging 

The therapist facilitates perspective bridging between partners:

Speaker B: "Even there where there were things, Amanda, that you weren't seeing that Daniel was attempting to execute. Even if you disagree with with what was going on, there is you guys figuring out what the margin is..."

This actively demonstrates how to acknowledge multiple valid perspectives without prioritizing one over the other. #perspective-bridging #bidirectional-understanding

### Pattern Interruption

The therapist introduces pattern interruption strategies:

Speaker B: "And I'm not saying like, values like you're going to have 38 parenting values in a workbook and it's going to be colour coded and all of that. That's not what I mean. I just mean this idea of, hey, an ethic around..."

This practically addresses the tendency toward perfectionism or overwhelm that might prevent implementation of the suggested approach. #pattern-interruption #practical-implementation

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Double Empathy Problem Research

The application of the double empathy problem to intimate partnerships aligns with Milton's (2012) original conceptualization but extends it into new territory. Recent research by Fletcher-Watson and Happé (2019) has begun exploring how this concept applies beyond single social interactions to ongoing relationships, supporting the therapist's application in this context. #double-empathy-problem #evidence-based-practice

### Neurodivergent Couples Research

The therapist's approach aligns with emerging research on neurodivergent couples by Moreno et al. (2023), which identifies the need for structured communication protocols that accommodate different processing styles. The session demonstrates practical application of these research findings in therapeutic contexts. #neurodivergent-couples #evidence-based-practice

### Monotropism Theory

The discussion of monotropism's impact on relationship dynamics connects to Murray, Lesser & Lawson's (2005) monotropism theory, particularly how differences in attention allocation affect interpersonal understanding. Recent extensions of this theory by Murray (2018) specifically address how monotropic focus can impact family dynamics, supporting the therapeutic approach demonstrated. #monotropism #attention-allocation

### Neurodevelopmental Parenting Teams

The session approach aligns with research by Dissanayake et al. (2020) on co-parenting in neurodevelopmentally diverse families, which identifies the benefits of complementary parenting styles when effectively coordinated. The therapist's emphasis on values rather than procedures reflects emerging best practices in supporting neurodivergent parenting partnerships. #neurodivergent-parenting #evidence-based-practice
