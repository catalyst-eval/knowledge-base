\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 [] Speaker #A: Where'did d you get coffee? D Duncin.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah that's right around the corner front of my house. Okay so you're oh you're in that apartment complex. Yeah Surprise ahead and run over because we'shop that public right?\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah yeah. Um we shop there too all the time because it's like it's hard not to.\
[] Speaker #B: Right there. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So the Duncan right there is just like ungodly convenient. Yeah it's like hello so I'll leave and like good about some had coffee like probably four out of five days of the week from there for the past few weeks since I opened. Not saying it's a good habit but.\
[] Speaker #B: I'm not jud it's so convenient.\
[] Speaker #A: That's the thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah it's like right there. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So her first CL was cancelled so her first class is cancelled. So she was here doing homework. Yes.\
[] Speaker #B: There's a cockroach carcass up there.\
[] Speaker #A: Instantlyyrigh. So she was like on the computer doing work this morning I sat down and do the same thing. I probably saw a bagel on my face.\
[] Speaker #B: I don't know. No you I think you got it.\
[] Speaker #A: You know everything bagel is always just little rem.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: You know.\
[] Speaker #B: Oh yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I started doing little work too which was cute and like we could do coffee so I okay so that's a kind of compromise I'm trying to strike where like I'm working till 8 o'clock at night but like yesterday I got five something because she had her graduation photos she to be the arch by 6:45 in the morning.\
[] Speaker #B: Good lord.\
[] Speaker #A: So and then I didn't really to work till noon yesterday and then if could only work for like four or five hours and then sure nothing productive happened after that.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So I'm starting a compromise I think is been fine of like me working a crazy am my hours but like I still make time.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Because you little things. Yeah. You're in charge so you get.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah that's also why I'm here now because I'm like I forgot we had this scheduled not I knew it was Fridays but I didn't know what time. Sure forgot put in the calendar but then I was like fucking I'll just do it right. But anyways I'm. It's been very chaotic work wise because. Because certain projects that should have already been done are lingering and other projects that are been in the wings are now starting.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay so I'm just having these worlds.\
[] Speaker #A: Collide and I was having a lot of anxiety about it like yesterday or this Week I've just been just getting like there'd be certain hours where like I'll get 10 phone calls in a row. Like I cannot get off the phone.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And I'm here to the point where I'm. I'll talk about my mother in law yesterday.\
[] Speaker #B: M. Hmm.\
[] Speaker #A: Night before last because she was in town for the photos.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: That was good. It was great to see her. And we're going to Carville tomorrow through Sunday afternoon for Easter. So that'll be chill. Um, basically. But I don't even want to go because I'm just like at the point where I'm like. Just the thought of going somewhere even for the weekend, I just don't think I have the bandwidth.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: I just want to be home.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But I'll go. And realically based upon right nows I'm gonna go. Which do paperwork the entire fucking weekend. And they go right toor work Monday. Because it's just like everything is collided. So my usual routine of well have Monday off. I did the weekend off and sure. It's just not working because of the external demand.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm accepting of that. So I'm also not like I'm just going to bed whenever I'm getting up, whatever. I work until whenever. So I'm really not trying to judge myself too strong. And even yesterday I was getting frustrated. Then I was like ivious I need. I'm not hyrated do that cirle back. I felt better. I got more solution ored got back on the ball. But it was talking to her. She was like. She was like basically me her concluded that like I think one of the next things I need to delegate is I need to just delegate my phone. Just not be answering the phone, not be talk to people like, sure I need to but like actually take that seriously and system because like I think I'm losing most of my mental acuity to constant onlaught of information.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: I think I'm very productive. What I do. I can get a lot of stuff done, but just the constant phone calls and being the person to juggle everything is just not working.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: So I need to. My gameay is tonight go to South Maine. The big job we're doing. Try and get done. But it's been like pulling teeth because like I have. It's just. It's just a mess in the sense that like the house looks great. It's all going really well. We're behind schedule because of like cabinets got delayed me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: I remember.\
[] Speaker #A: But then I go over the weekend go put cabinet door handles on. I forgot to ask what they wanted them wasn't where they want them. I need to or countgoors dumb shit like that. That's just like dumb mistakes.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I'm tired or I didn't ask. I forgot to ask. They never told me. And then I'm still a one. That's wrong. Right. So it's fine. So I fixed it. But then there's just like all this just like rigidity from the customer suddenly. Whereas this entire time. Oh yeah, that's fine. Whatever. Like it's 110 year old house.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: We're in there. How is'in there? Months ago. Looking at the floors. There's a section that been passed previously from who knows when.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: And it was patched wrong. But it's still secure and stable. But it's just the grains wrong. So we look at say hey, do you want to change this? And then the customer says, no, no, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Not really a big deal. We understand the nature of the whole and character and all this stuff.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So florng guy Sands stains put down the first coat of poly, puts down the second coat of poly. There's three coats. Then the homeowner like hey, can we get this section fixed? 2 coats of poly in. No, motherfucker. We can't out this 16 square feet of floor because you don't like how the grain looks on a house that is level nowhere and is beat. The fuck that we brought back from the dead. When the entire brief of this remodel was just make it livable. That was the brief.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: Was the conclusion was make it live. Make it as nice as we can. But we re.\
[] Speaker #B: We're not. We compromising. There's.\
[] Speaker #A: We're not perfecting anything.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. We're not gonna get. We're not gonna gut job. We're not gonna restore. We're not gonna.\
[] Speaker #A: And it's like. And like I've been so honestly the point where'm I'm getting very frustrated and very short.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Not with the customer directly, but internally.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I'm just like, you re maxed. I'm maxed out. And I'I'M maxed out in sen. Like I'm just done. I'm done having like here's one the I suggested why suggested. I agree. Why I h a lot of stuff out. I've really. Well. Okay. Don't know if I told you about that.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I had a long conversation he was there yesterday, helped me out o the range hood, vented because I just don't do that. And he'like willing to come do it. So u there's. There's a window above where the stove is, but according to code, you can't have a window behind a gas stove.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: So we had to cover it, but it was okay. Yeah, cover. It's fine. And then right as I'COVER it. No, don't cover it. And then only cover half of it. So then we only cover half. I like. I really like to cover the whole thing with the shift lap. He's like, the customers want to die on this hill of not covering it. And I knew we had to put a range hood there. I'm like, it's give like, yeah. So my day when I leave here is go change and go to the job and trim this out. How do you think I'm going to trim this out and make this look good?\
[] Speaker #B: Oh, fuck that.\
[] Speaker #A: How is that gonna look good? And's in weeks of talking about getting rid of the window, he's like, nope, I won't do it. It's the only thing I'm not go going toa do we have to have that window? I'm like, you're not gonna fucking see the window. You're gonna have probably four inches of glass. Oh, God. Right. So it's stuff like that. We're right at the end, right when I want to be done.\
[] Speaker #B: It's like all of a sudden those.\
[] Speaker #A: Last teeth and those last things. It's also part of, like, details that when we were doing the kitchen layout, I didn't think about five months ago, because also we didn't pay an architect to do a $4,000, you know, elevations of just the kitchen. Like, the kitchen was an add on a month into the project of like.\
[] Speaker #B: Hey, while we're here, might as well, right?\
[] Speaker #A: Go ahead and do it kind of thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Fuck.\
[] Speaker #A: Right.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. That's messed up.\
[] Speaker #A: Like, so I'm over here doing stuff like this, and then at the same time on a different job, I'm doing work like this.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Where I'm like, ah, it's so nice. And the customers, like, over the moon about it. And like, it s just like, yeah, it's gorgeous and I'm proud of it. It looks great.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: All nice material. PVC and aluminium. All gorgeous stuff. And this is a remodel. This is a redecking. I'm not even doing this from scratch. I'm making this elevated. Right. So I'm just like, Happy at this one job. Oh, this is good.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Then you have to back to my.\
[] Speaker #A: Bear of a job where I'm like polishing this just piece of shit scario. And then they'll then come in and say this thing isn't quite centred. I'm like, I'm gonna fucking kill somebody. Like y'all need to just let me be done and get the fuck on. Even my foreign guy whose s neighbours with a customer in a different property, two houses, he's on the foreoo. He told him, he's like, let's just get done and I'll come back as neighbours on a Saturday and we'll just tinker with this one section or something like that. Right. Because he's just like, you need to.\
[] Speaker #B: We need to be.\
[] Speaker #A: To be done. Like we're like, yeah, but it's like the. I always like something changes in like homeowners brains was right before done. Then like all of a sudden like this like.\
[] Speaker #B: Well, yeah, once. Once they leave then we're stuck with this or whatever.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. It's like. But we've had. We've been here for months. Where was this whole mentality of thoughtfulness over the past few months?\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: So anyways, that's just frustrating. I want to get done but I've been trying to do better at delegating. Like I walked the job two days ago with my dad. Now he's here full time and he made an exhausted list of everything has be done. Like more than I had made. I'm talking like two and a half pages of light items. Every round to this one room needs this light bulb kind of thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: So he made the list. He's there right now. He's on top of working with electrician. Getting it all there.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So now I'm not in my. I'm not even thinking about everything that has he done. I just know I have to trim up that rangeer.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And hang a mirror. That's my day today. Like it's not. So then I've been able to take this morning, like actually do emails and paperwork and we have these commercial jobs coming up all with the same GC who I'm friends with.\
[] Speaker #B: Mm hmm.\
[] Speaker #A: And I talked to him today and he said, hey, it's really our fault all three of these jobs are landing at the same time. And that's not your fault. He's like, just do.\
[] Speaker #B: You can't do what you can. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So it was like really good to have that phone call this morning to start the day.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: That got My mental bandwidth like freed up because like, okay, yep. I'm not in trouble. I'm gonna do what I can. So I guess here.\
[] Speaker #B: So here's the thing. I'm kind of word on here, but no, no, no.\
[] Speaker #A: So it's very chaotic. I have. It doesn't matter to you maybe, but just for my own sake. There's three commercial jobs. I got one in Bethlehem, I got one in Gainesville, one green. Those are all back to back to back.\
[] Speaker #B: Uh hu.\
[] Speaker #A: I got a master bathroom model in Georgia Club. I got a front portion Bishop. I've got the big house in Watkinsville, Downown Watinsville. I got. And then I have two houses in the east side.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: At the same time. So I got eight jobs. Yeah, but three. The three commercials haven't started y yetah. They're just t orders pre construction for me. But I've not gone on site yet, so it's really like whatever. Then I have two commercial spaces to refinish, to redo. So there's a flower shop and there's a med spa.\
[] Speaker #B: Those are pre construction too.\
[] Speaker #A: Also pre construction. So I got, I got two pre construction realistically as far as like. But like the schedule is dictating and then need need be done by the middle of June. So it's gonna have to go like that once you get started. But like the Bishop job, South Main street over in Walkkinsville, uh, the house on the east side, these are things those can all get put to bed like within a few days.\
[] Speaker #B: U hu.\
[] Speaker #A: So I'm just like in this weird.\
[] Speaker #B: It's that like in between like I.\
[] Speaker #A: Gotta get these puts rest and get paid. It's not the money. I'm not even worried about the cash flow. Like that's not even the concern right now.\
[] Speaker #B: It's the executive function.\
[] Speaker #A: It's just executive. I'm just like, like yes. Like I was yesterday, Tuesday ago, I was at the front porch job making good progress. We get rolling, but then I open up the panelling for the panelss or one of my helpers does Graham, who's goated and he sends me a picture. He's like, hey, these are bent. They got shipp to us. And so had run them over. So then I know that until now I got order new ones I can't get done. It takes few days to get in their special order, so then that. But the customer gets it. And they're so happy and over the moon about the project.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I think it looks so much better than they planned that she Was like, oh, just take your time. And you've more than earned that. Whatever. Sure. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Great. So I'm like, incredible flexibility on certain projects.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Which is great. But then I have these, like random thorns in my side.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But basically most of them, except for the one I've gotten kind of early that to the Georgia Club bathroom is going good. But they're very anxious. Or a couple.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And they're not. They're not accustomed. They don't have an appetite for a gut remodel. But they've wanted a gutel. So we're in the middle of it. But that one's. We're on the end of the third week and we already have the floor tile down. 250et square foot master bathroom gutted. It did a curbless entry shower, dry electrical plumbing. I mean, it's. We've busted out within three weeks. So that one's moving along soimgly. But the point is that, like, as of this morning, I'm feeling like. Because I've gotten the permission to not be stressed about certain things. But that's where it comes to betweeni I. How do I. How do I. So the other day when I was having all these phone calls, I was at the deck job trying to get some stuff done. And I'm not shitting you. I mean, it was probably 15 phone calls back to back to back to back to back to back to back. I could not put my phone down.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm trying to measure and cut something. And I literally felt like I was gonna have an anxiety attack.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I handled it fine. And everyone's like, you're just so calm. I'm like, I don't know how y'all think that because internally I'm screaming.\
[] Speaker #B: Ye.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm just tired of the. I'm tired of the burnout. I'REALLY burnout. I don't even feel burnt out. I'm just. I'm just miserable.\
[] Speaker #B: It'like getting kind of pecke to death. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm just getting constantly. Just nudged.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: If I could just not be nudged. If I had like 24 hours to reset. I'm fucking.\
[] Speaker #B: You're good to go.\
[] Speaker #A: I feel like my battery capacity, as we talked about, is so much more broad than it was last year because of these tools and a more intentional executive feel. Like I'm able to take it and dish it out. So. But I can only take it so much back to back to that before. I'm just like. I can't process the information. So my point then Is like, how do I take these? Look like gummy bear or like they look like. Yeah, they look like gun. Like. Like candy. That's kind of cool.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: How do I take the. The thing I'm experiencing. I'm really scatter today. The thing I'm experiencing is in the problem I've had the job where it feels like a throw on my side is having to manage other people's emotions and expectations and demands and things like that. If I could just not talk to anyone. You just show up every day and plug away and get stuff done and just do the work. Yeah, I can do the work 80 hours a week and have a smile on my face.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: And keep progressing all that stuff. What affects me internally is the people like there's a problem, so it feels like the end of the world to them. Yeah, I know I can fix it. But having just to constantly talk people off the fucking ledge.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And deal with that with the commercial guys. Today I Talked to fucking 5 people from the same company because I got 3 jobs with 3 supers and 2 senior PM all the same business. So I called Everybody Day, like 7am but over there, they're like, oh, yeah, we get it. And, you know, we're all here to get this done together.\
[] Speaker #B: And yeah, let us know what you need.\
[] Speaker #A: I. So, hey, I'll be there three days a week until we're done. Could take eight to 10 weeks, but I'm should to keep showing up. And they said, sure. I said, great. So now there's not this like. Like I can let myself off the hook. So speak.\
[] Speaker #B: Mmm.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I, like, I got permission to not stress about it.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: But how do. How can I let myself off the hook to not stress about it when the person's not giving me the permission to. But I need to.\
[] Speaker #B: Yes.\
[] Speaker #A: Like, I like the Georgia Club customer. Oh, there's all this anxiety. Oh my gosh. But the dust or this, there's that. So. So I'm like, okay, I'll send someone over there right now to come clean the entire job site right in the day. So for them, what was the biggest problem in their mind? I had solved within an hour to. I set Max there, cleaned it, put down new plastic, new ran board, took down desin Mar, put new ones back up, done. And they're like, wow, this is so great. And, you know, we appreciate you taking care of. Sure. So on the end. On the other end of it, it's like amazing. But on the front end, I'm only getting the. Hey, it's sun getting that the plastic is crooked. We're tripping on it. Can you please fix this? I'm just like, yeah, I super happy to. Don't fucking text me on Sunday. Or I'm super happy to like I perceive it as a problem. I perceive it as a threat or a confrontation.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: When really it's not. And I don't know how to disarm that.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. It's that rejection sensitivity.\
[] Speaker #A: Hundred percent. I have a very strong rejection sensivity that is rearing its head. I'm making strides in some areas where we had this one that that shutter job that will never go to bed.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: The project manager ye cannot order the right stuff. And then there's to come out for free to do three rounds of punch outs, which I'm not going to do. No u I talked to te text called the guy said we're not coming outless. You you pay us. And the guy says, well, I can't get invoice approve. And he said, well, sucks to suck. And so I delegated that away. Sure. And now I feel great about it and that's solve But I don't want to have that conversation for some reason because I want everyone to like me. So how can I balance this? Because I know the danger there is. Well, if you'renn. If you're always trying to please people, you set undue expectations on yourself and you can't deliver, ultimately people are not happy. Better saying, hey, we're six months out, we can't do it. They you don't like that. I don't want to tell them that. But then six months later they're like, wow, this is awesome.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And then they're happy in the end.\
[] Speaker #B: How can I yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Throw the needle on this concept?\
[] Speaker #B: Well, I would argue that it's less like thread the needle and more like kind of how. How do we bulldoze the appropriate path. Okay, meaning like some of what the technique or the ethic that you I've cultivated here is this idea of there's certain things where we're like, yeah, okay, this sucks, but you're gonna have to reverse engineer this and reset a structure and a system and then execute it. And then that's going to take some of the. Some of the hot sauce out of whatever that is.\
[] Speaker #A: See, when you say it like that, even you just say, hey, what's the path? We're going to bulldoze that. Just like that mental image I have that feels like my stress level goes down.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I feel like I have some Like I want to be in control or be the expert and then just be able to tell people I got it and then yeah here's what we're doing and I feel that way with regards to thate practise or the trade or what needs to happen on the job. It's the, it's the interpersonal social part that I can do but I can all I cannot sustain because we like.\
[] Speaker #B: We talked about getting pecke to death.\
[] Speaker #A: Is and I have, I think I have the like talk three say like the I can ramp up the executive function to go meet with a customer and really just fucking.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Like people please and get them exactly where I want them to be, where they also want to be and solve the problem and reassure stuff. But I can't do that 10 times in a row the same day.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I only have enough bandwidth to like hey yeah, yeah okay and then I need to go fuck off and go reset. Get back to my.\
[] Speaker #B: And that's, that's, that's adhd. Right. We know that's that hyper to hypo andlish. You can do it really well.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah, I can.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. But if it's too, too much too much pecking then you totally. It does burn out and that's what.\
[] Speaker #A: I found that's been my biggest thing. It's not been the workload of actual physical work.\
[] Speaker #B: Rightg A lot of the administrative it's. It's the constant like people management. Yeah. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And everyone's like oh why would't you just hire someone take for the phone for you. I'm like yes.\
[] Speaker #B: But yeah there's certain things, certain nuances.\
[] Speaker #A: Here that someone randomly Office street does not understand that's important to the brand. I've established my company thateah I want to maintain as the customer experience.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I don't want to just delegate to some answering service and then nowden they're.\
[] Speaker #B: Not getting, they're not you're. They're not providing the, the service and the way that's your standard.\
[] Speaker #A: Exactly. So it's not that my long term goal would be to not delegate that. Like I'd love to delegate that within the year and have that system in place. It's just that I don't want to havephazardly do that and then I'm now creating a different problem. I'm just moving problem. I'm not really fixing it.\
[] Speaker #B: I'm writing notes as you go.\
[] Speaker #A: You're fine. Because the problem would be less of than nudging and then it would turn into quality Control.\
[] Speaker #B: Exactly.\
[] Speaker #A: And for me quality control is almost more of a frustration than the nudging because I hate having to come back and then fixings or find problems that were not there before.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: That. And that comes down to. We've talked about before the issue of like I don't like. I know the punch outs there. I don't like being told it's there.\
[] Speaker #B: He's gonna piss me off'the paradoxy.\
[] Speaker #A: Let me get it done and then we can talk about what I didn't see.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Kind of thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. U. This is. Okay. So part of what we're doing here that's. And you've been doing this already but now you know, now as things have picked up as it does. I mean. Right. This is the time of year where this kind of starts to happen in your industry. Yeah. 100% right. Is the theoretical macro. Top level is role and task definition.\
[] Speaker #A: Real quick not to off.\
[] Speaker #B: No, you're good.\
[] Speaker #A: Add this. You know, I've been having this whole conflict about like my Bioa and Thursdays JC's board and all and all these extraur killers and all this stuff as of this week with how just like strain I've been on executiveing function. I'm feeling less of a sting surrounding disappointing or letting down certain people in certain contexts. Like nope, not doing it and I don't even care. Whereas like three months ago when I had a bandwidth do I really I was like too anxious about disappointing certain people. And now I'LIKE well, in my mind I want to str irons hot and make as much money as possible to be successful as possible. So I'm going to focus my energy where that is the situation and then where I can then provide for myself and my family. Like this is my kind of hierarchy here. So I'm feeling less sting about that being like look, I don't have the time for this. Sorry.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: In extracurricular area.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: You know, because the workload has tripled.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: You know.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. I mean that's a.\
[] Speaker #A: It was just a nice progress I felt like I made in my mind of like I don't care if they think that I'm being flaky. I'm gonna do this.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure. No, it's good because I mean per. Per. What you and I have talked about before. The. The space in here for you from the standpoint of. Yeah. Be stream of consciousness. Because then you're. Then what you're doing is you're offloading the pecking.\
[] Speaker #A: No it really what this is because the reality Is that I can't really. I can't really accomplish that with Katie.\
[] Speaker #B: Mm hmm.\
[] Speaker #A: In. In. Not ever. But like now she's in the middle of finals. She's like four 16 page papers she has to write which is just like horrible. And I'm just like okay, so you're in the same spot. We're not explaining ourselves to each other. We're not really even wored about having dinner together or we doing just like let's just get through this season. And I'm happy with that.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But the problem I run into is that I can't get this out to anybody because I feel like I can't articulate it. But with you, because you understand.\
[] Speaker #B: Ye I can't.\
[] Speaker #A: It's super advantageous.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Like I almost feel like. It's almost like. Yeah. Could I be in the job for an hour today? Absolutely. But the. The dividend from this is a much more productive week next week.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: To do this.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Yeah. You're. Even if I talked back you and he was like right. It would still. It doesn't matter. Right. Where. All right, that's weird. But what I was thinking was.\
[] Speaker #A: What Great.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure. But that's the point is like you know and that that makes it to where a warm body t. Sometimes I'm 100% that where I'm like I don't. These clients I have. We have gone over the same thing four times in a row and all of a sudden they're getting it today. And I didn't do anything different. Matter of fact, I don't feel good today. Right.\
[] Speaker #A: Like someow. So good result.\
[] Speaker #B: Right. It's like. Yeah, you just. It just happens.\
[] Speaker #A: That's showing up.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. No, that's what I mean is like. Yeah, yeah, that's.\
[] Speaker #A: That's what me like, man, we talk about this for a year. He just doesn't fucking understand.\
[] Speaker #B: No, this is fun. We're talking. This is different shit. Yeah. This is different.\
[] Speaker #A: Getting deeper into nuance.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. It's easier. Right.\
[] Speaker #A: Like you.\
[] Speaker #B: You're not gonna be able. Your foundation is gonna fucking suck if you don't have it graded. Right. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: Right. And so like that's. And we're not even at a foundational place. We're a.\
[] Speaker #A: Or no, we.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, you're just. Yeah. You're just. Yeah, yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: It's really all we've been doing.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So my thoughts here and this is us just kind of like, you know, spitballing. Yeah. So what you're describing is that that front five and back five. That whole like the first 5% of the job. It's hard to get it. It's hard to get it going because there's the front five. So much of the interaction is, you know, client facing and so on.\
[] Speaker #A: I think we're landing like a 10 right now because we combine the tunes. I'm starting and stopping at the same time on different track.\
[] Speaker #B: Right. And that's.\
[] Speaker #A: That's the strength.\
[] Speaker #B: That's the streng.\
[] Speaker #A: The middle of it. Like at the bathroom where I have tile going and my tile guy self sufficient on. Yeah. That's the flow.\
[] Speaker #B: Stateick.\
[] Speaker #A: That's fucking awesome. And making money.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, it's yah. So it's. It's five. It's then flow and then it's five. And that's what you're noticing that's frustrating my perfectionism. I'm like no, this will not do. Okay, 5%, then flow and then 5%. These are the. These two. Here are the ones that you're targeting.\
[] Speaker #A: And really, you know's interesting illustrate it that way is that those are two parts of the process that have the hardest time delegating and have the hardest time explaining to people.\
[] Speaker #B: Yes.\
[] Speaker #A: That like my dad's here now. He's down. He's 100 committed. Whatever you can do to help. He's here to help and all that stuff. But if I got. If I got five front.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Backs going at the same time. It took me an hour and a half to delegate the one back five to him. Just the one house in Walkinsvill.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So it's like.\
[] Speaker #B: Well, that hour and a half won't stay an hour and a half.\
[] Speaker #A: No, it'get better.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But the thing is like that's a. That's a really nuanced thing that I think people just don't think about.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: That you're kind of likeail head.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. And. And that's. And I think some of what hopefully we've normalised too. It was either the last time or the time before that where I was like yeah, sorry. Like where there's an element of your hardware and software that you can handle it up to a certain point that the vast majority of humans can't.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm finding that too where I realise that I don't really know that I found a counterpart too.\
[] Speaker #B: And I'm probably notn you. Yeah. Not that's going to execute it in the way that you would conceptualise it. Yeah. And so what that means though is that try to get. We try to bear down on the role in task definition meaning like yeah, there's a seasonality to this where okay, it's happening this way this year is come next year if the same cascade is happening. You're not gonna. You're like hey O ye this is one of those times I've already kind.\
[] Speaker #A: Of been seeing the trend of which is why I'm not having this existential crisis.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Oh my gosh. I'm sad. I'm so burnt out and tired. I'm very much like yeah, I'm tired. But I know this is only go going to last for so long. So I really don't care. I'm tired. I'm so accepting of seasonality now.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: It's like last year I was like when will this ever end? I'm like it's gonna end. So I'm just like chilling, you know.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. It's like landscapers or whatever. Right. Like, you know you're gonna do the whole winterizing and then. And then two months, two and a half months of nothing or very little and then. Then fucking go ye and then like you know. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But I kind of like that it'my personality accepting it it no longer the roadloc I will.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Seasonality is also applying when hey okay. Ye stuff is ramped back up. Therefore some of what you would typically be doing personal life wise it just goes back down and that's it. That's the seasonality for you and you just accept it as it is. I think the rolland tasks stuff. So one we've got this whole the back this back five, we've got what is the thorn? The thorn inside rolell meaning yeah. You spendt an hour and a half with your dad putting together the punch out thing. But this is the one that is most vexing. I know that tending to people here. But you're just. That's when you're the salesman sell the job which I have my checklist with.\
[] Speaker #A: That for the weekend. I have three different ones that are all hot. Really? Two ones that are really hot. They'already gave me the keys the shop. I just get them the contract y and give them the final price and then it's basically mine.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I see a priority in those where it takes energy. I have to make time for it.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But I know that based upon the commitments I've made say hey we can do this timeline. I can be your solution to your problem. Ye I need to deliver and I need to make time for it. Because it's more of like that if I don't in a few months we'll have nothing to do kind of thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep. You you with whether it's your dad or a combination of folks, it's that create that finisher role where more or less it sounds like your dad is doing this having to do with that job. But that's where say what it was is you were burnt out. You're like, I cannot do another day. I would go, okay, what semi arbitrary percentage levels are we on? The ones that are close to being done. And move all of your move all of your resources to finishing. It's snowball debt pay exactly where it's like. Whereas I'm like, yes, I know you've got to sell jobs and so on, but throw everything you've got.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. So really the way I can sot part of conbation two weeks ago was how do I ascertain when I have free time where I need to be prioritising? So really if I just think what's the biggest thorn or potential thorn in myself?\
[] Speaker #B: Yes.\
[] Speaker #A: That is how I can actually determine priority.\
[] Speaker #B: That's when you go, oh, it's bothering me. Therefore it's the priority. Not like, you know what I mean, right. Where you're not go going toa like split hairs unnecessarily, but it's going toa be kind of going like, hey, this is. If I was like saying rol and task definition wise, right. I would prioritise for you the front five and the keeping stuff in flow state'rather you'd rather redirect the barge a half a degree than like you said show up there and go o fuck. Right? And all right. You got to back that up and right. You'd rather be involved here.\
[] Speaker #A: I agree. It's not that I'm not good at the last part. I can do it because I've been hired dozens of times to be the punch out guy.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: So I have all the skill set to do the entire punch list myself. But the reality is that it's literally a drain on resources and time and profitability, me being the one to have to ste that shit.\
[] Speaker #B: And you would still get, you know, like sometimes I'm not that trim job, but sometimes, you know, when I was doing stuff like this, I was like, yeah, I want to do the bun out on this one because I would enjoy a certain aspect of whatever it was.\
[] Speaker #A: Or maybe you took it off pride what you're doing that you wanted to see it from reality on certain jobs like the front porch where I'm really happy, I'm really proud of it. I'm going to be the one who do the punch outs cause I really.\
[] Speaker #B: Care about you get to decide.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah but with this one where it's like we just need to be done I need these I need co yeah I need the place inspected and put.\
[] Speaker #B: The bed yeah this is your target area's this it's this last five where whether it's a whether it's a role or a task sl strategy where you could go you know you could go you could whatever the whatever the call sign is or the high sign is.\
[] Speaker #A: To your team thing about this not to good y all is that this part I find to be inconvenience but I don't dislike it. This part I'm in love with I love the right and the funny thing is that I've been trying to I need to talk to my dad tonight because once the FL guys get there to put the last bit of poly on tonight we can't work at the jobore Right. So my thought process is just say look dad I'll leave in town tomorrow tonight on the phone guys are here let's go back to the clubhouse and sit down I need to have a 23 hour meeting to and this actually using the I need because the problem having a diet right now is that he does not know where he fits into what needs to happen and this is where that is because I need to define what is your role and what are you good at.\
[] Speaker #B: Yes.\
[] Speaker #A: I find that he's not good at these two because he's either kind of.\
[] Speaker #B: Like scattered maybe he's either too micromanaging.\
[] Speaker #A: Or or just like completely dumb like clueless and doesn't know what's going on. There's no between for him.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: As far as like I say hey I need the front five. I need a material order I need a takeoff he'll sit there and then and for some reason magically forget the linear footage of the door opening for how much one by four. I need I need to explain to other sure or in the flow state he's in there to wored about oh.\
[] Speaker #B: This is min detail just this this.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm like yes but you're not seeing the bigger picture hereeah and you're wasting too long making the blocking level when the blocking just needs to be flush to the framing. I don't care level it's blocking let's get because it's going to have drywall just backer for a grab bar it doesn't so you're just sennd two hours on inst set of blocking. That's a waste of time. But maybe where he can shine is there. I say looked at. I don't care if you spend two hours as one detail because it has to be. I need the scrutinise. So I hear. Because I don't want to hear anything from the customer because that's where I get the biggest drain of my executive function. When's like ding problem lookuck.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: That's where I get completely disraileed.\
[] Speaker #B: That's that's it is that's the point is that we've just identified what is the most difficult. You are the face of the company. Therefore sell the job. Get it get text brings me text.\
[] Speaker #A: Does the other 95% of this H he gets theer he qualifies he needss meas he gets the pictures everything. 5% of this is I have to do the estimate. I have to write the contract. I have to maybe do one pre construction meeting with the customer to confirm what the f we're doing to make sure they're off base on anything. Right. So this is like like the 5% of the sales is more pre construction and estimatingh it's really not you know the the entirety of sales text handles the majority. So really I think where I'm shining is hey take right or text can't do anything more which is pricing. I take it from there and then I then get it into a flow state and then once the flow state ramping down I need to pass off to that to say hey yep, our flow rate ramping down.\
[] Speaker #B: We're going stop.\
[] Speaker #A: We're going to start losing momentum. I need to make sure like they like the curdling room on the Olympics.\
[] Speaker #B: Or Yeah you need to be the.\
[] Speaker #A: One with fuck need to get get.\
[] Speaker #B: It right right spot.\
[] Speaker #A: That's what it is. Otherwise we loser momentum quickly it just stops and then I need to build it that up again which is where I'm losing this executive function. It is's a trim job next week for the commercial.\
[] Speaker #B: Dude.\
[] Speaker #A: I I can make two phone calls today. They're happy. Hey, I got everything in Motjion. We'll be there Thursday, Friday. I ordered the trim it's getting delivered and then so they're happy and for me it's not a problem to solve task to do to get that flow moving.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep. Because you you're literally at this point you're by the very nature of the job you're. You are exiting flow state. You have to you don't function with.\
[] Speaker #A: That Well, I need to stay in that to actually be productive and profitable.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: That's really money s make.\
[] Speaker #B: That's the point. And so now, now we've gotten your role and task even more clear. Yeah. Crush that first one and a half percent where if you know that on that day you've got a job that you know'just like perfect for, for y'all or whatever.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: Is that idea where you're like, no, I'm. I am off the grid because I'm goingna sell this fucker and we're gonna. It'snna be like. It's going to be like blam. Because. Because once teh gets you the rest of the way through the first five, the flo. The flow state'gonna like. I'm thinking of like a boat, a big old boat launching. Right. Where they like put it on an angular, like slides. Right.\
[] Speaker #A: It doesn't take anything to get me in the flow state. I set up the first five impact.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: The flow state increase because the motivation is there to do the job.\
[] Speaker #B: Right. Because this excitement, it's the novelty. It's the new thing. It's money. Yeah. Yeah. You're. You've already gotten some of your, you know, sequence checks and whatever up to this point. Right. So you're talking about the last little bit.\
[] Speaker #A: There's no more novelty.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: That's the thing. I think that's where is. There's.\
[] Speaker #B: That's the ADHD experience's novelty.\
[] Speaker #A: Starting something but not finishing it.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And I think for my dad, he doesn't handle. He can juggle things really well, but I don't think he handles like, knowing where it's the most effective.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Like, hey, he struggles the shift all these things donemm. He can do all them, but he t understand how much time should I spend him as one task. Am I saying too much time on something kind of thing? Do you set priority?\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. So here's what we know about you. The first. First 1.5%. Okay. That's like. That's the one that. That's like the role that will trump whatever else is going.\
[] Speaker #A: That's the one thing I probably cannot delegate because that's.\
[] Speaker #B: That's. You're selling. You're selling the business. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: That's what. Yeah, that's. That's that one. Okay, so the first one and a half percent, then, you know, we could be arbitrary having to do with the flow state, but like the flow state is kind of like the bumpers on a bowling Alleyeah right. Like you re. You're the bumpers. In that case you can't do. You can't micromanage everybody.\
[] Speaker #A: And I think I'm good at just saying hey, this do that.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm the bumpers of quality control and timeline schedule and efficiency.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So I respect that. That's where Dag gets caught up where he tries to.\
[] Speaker #B: You don't need him to do that.\
[] Speaker #A: I need do that because he tries to thread the need too much on where it should be a bumper lane.\
[] Speaker #B: Ye.\
[] Speaker #A: And that's a problem. Any wastes money and time doing the work because then there's too much micromanage.\
[] Speaker #B: Ye. Do you also occupy this role that most people can't do? You and I are kindred spirits here. With this you can manage the macro and the micro. The big picture and the detail.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: I that looking at both and that's. That isn't. Most humans can't. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: They're very fix and or the other. Right.\
[] Speaker #B: Is that's. That's what makes you good at what you do. It's what makes me good at what I do where I can like get all like analogical in the weeds with somebody and then kind of go sometimes I'll go no, okay. No, that's not what this ise Fucking move on.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: Let's focus on this.\
[] Speaker #A: Go from this microro to look at your business projections for next quarter and.\
[] Speaker #B: Say o GE actually we just. We just did this. You go how do I thread the needle? I said fuck that. This is not a thread the needle. This is fucking bulldoz the fuck out of it. And then establish.\
[] Speaker #A: This is helped me actually understand that because like I know what needs. I know what I can do. I don't know how to get the right people the right stuff to remove my pain.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. In effect the rejection sensitivity you were experiencing was because of the executive function strain and getting some kind of malconten you already. It's like the first punch made you a little bit woozy and then the second punch week and last week I.\
[] Speaker #A: Probably had multiple punches every single day.\
[] Speaker #B: And that's the point for a few weeks in a row. And that's the point is we're. You're like literally tag teaming with this finisher where you're like hey dad, these are the punches you take. They're not the ones that I'm going to take. I will take them when they reach a certain. If there's a certain level, priority level or some kind of macro or micro that is Important for me to solve. But other than that, I'm not gonna touch them.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. So I We have a whole list where it's like I need a dryer ven install thisance these. I'm like, go figure it out. I yeah, I'm trying to schede.\
[] Speaker #B: That's the one that I got about.\
[] Speaker #A: 7:15 this morning for a delivery of this composite fence in Gainesville where I cannot be today. And the drivers there hours before we should be. And then you know where to put this palte of fencing. And the supers not there. So I'MAKE all these phone calls. But that's flow state.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, that, that. And that's the one where. Yeah, there's gon be.\
[] Speaker #A: It's hard to delegate that because it's too specific.\
[] Speaker #B: Right. Because you're. That's where these two are connected. Yeah, those two. That phone call this morning. You're. You're the bumper there. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I had to make sure it was right. But it'also starting the job. So it's that 1.5.\
[] Speaker #B: 1.5%. Right. So this has to get going is you're doing a good job when you work yourself out of one. But there's certain ones where per the quality control and your desire for how the business operates and so on. And you'll be able to. As you get used to this role in task definition and the shift to the finisher, you'll get used the to what margin you have here to delegate and pass off or whatever.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. And I'm starting to see good delegation like with Max and Graham and sure. I've started like, hey, can you do this? You do really well. And now all of a sudden'm like, well, fuck, this is awesome. And now I have more bandwidth. I thought I would.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: And I can switch back to macro fix other problem.\
[] Speaker #B: Yes. How much of the. This is me shifting because the other big. The other big thorn inside is the phone.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: What percentage of the phone calls. This is ADHD in all of my.\
[] Speaker #A: You Fine. I want to get a picture of these.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, we'll do that.\
[] Speaker #A: I'LITERALLY reference these exactly. Tonight my dad.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Iron out. Hey, what's your role? How does that.\
[] Speaker #B: How does thatate to the company and part of what Part of what I would suggest there know this is me diverting from the phone is state. You know, and it not per who your dad is and what y'all's dynamic is like. It may not be important in this case, but provide what's important to you. Having to do with the role and then get buy in from that person going. And what else do you see as part of this role? Meaning like when we were talking about this stuff and the bottom line and so on over here. Yeah. Is that's you said. Oh yeah. The reason this is this first 1.5% is important is ownership.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: Is when you. When you talk to your dad about it and go okay, this is what I really have in mind for this finisher role. What else do you see?\
[] Speaker #A: What does ownership look like to you exactly. In this.\
[] Speaker #B: That gives them buy in. That's different. Where he would then. And that's what you're saying he got muddled because. Because you're his son and you know, et cetera. He was operating out of ownership. But in a murky. He didn't know what to do.\
[] Speaker #A: That's where I mean this whole thing. If he's not presenting a clear strike in any area y where I'm like, hey, can you get this blocking. Yeah, that takes like too long now wasting money blocking.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: Or hey, can you go do this one pass then he's micromanaging a sub. Well, no, that's their job. Let them do their like.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Trying to sort of.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: You know, or some days work and it's very okay. Other days it's like more like referhing like we're dad son hanging out. No. Here work. This is what easy get done.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: We can make time for a different juncture.\
[] Speaker #B: And that's why something like this is going to be really helpful. Because it defines what the role is, but subsequently makes the tasks much more clear.\
[] Speaker #A: Because he told me yesterday, he said I want just be like your girl Friday and you assistant or whatever.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because he wants to have his own ownership what we're doing and have actually authority whatever and feel good about it. And I don't want him to do that either because like I would love just to have an assistant to be one to answer my phone, to get send me check my email and whatever.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: That would be more appropriate for that. I'm saying dad was not. I don't want you to be that. But I need you to know what's happening. This would be a way create that ye through definition.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. The. The only other idea I have for the finisher would be. Well, it wouldn't be the finisher. I've got too many thoughts at once.\
[] Speaker #A: How about fun?\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: This is important.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Yeah, it is.\
[] Speaker #A: I think realistically, what creates the largest executive function Strain the phone.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. I'm just writing this down so I don't forget it.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah're good.\
[] Speaker #B: We'll get back to that one. Okay. So on the phone side. Phone's weird. I don't. I hate the phone.\
[] Speaker #A: Me too.\
[] Speaker #B: I just doesn't.\
[] Speaker #A: It doesn't suit me. It's necessary for our landscape in a modern landscape.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: How things operate. But I feel more often than not that the phone is the enemy to productivity.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because they can help you get certain things done faster. But as much as it helps you get things done faster, it also creates and creates. I will SC on the point now where I feel like I'd rather only communicate via email.\
[] Speaker #B: That was gonna be my question because.\
[] Speaker #A: The more while I don't like having 30, 50 emails in a day, at the same time when there's an email it creates a situation where it's less pressing.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I. If I could shift it to the only phone call that get our time sensitive things.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: And that require my attention right now, that'd be fine. Because the reality is that if I get stuff via email that I can focus on my task and when I'm done on that task, I can then get on the email and then I can.\
[] Speaker #B: You can do that one.\
[] Speaker #A: I can regulate when I'm letting it take time for me. Whereas when I'm constanting phone calls, I don't know why the person is calling. So because of that. So because of that. Oh, you could do this. Create a rule. If someone's answing this phone for me, it could simply be them at the only question they need to find out from the person that's calling is does this need to be looked at now or can this be emailed to Dom? Can. Can he get back to you later? Vi email. That's all I need. Because then if I, I get the phone call and there's a problem on the job, I have to go fix a problem or so you re put on a fire.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay, sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. Notify me. I'll head there right now and fix it. But if it was a question that was not time sensitive, that could be answered in 24 to 48 hours, why am I not just respond to that, the email that night at 6:00 or 7:00 or at home. So we're still getting the answer they need. We're still moving forward.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm just creating like a delay in it so I'm not constantly having to throttle my speed. I can rev at high speed. Productive.\
[] Speaker #B: On the job site, it's the flow state being flow and then that's what pissed you off when you were trying to cut that one piece. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I had fucking 15 phone calls. I was start screaming, I was like.\
[] Speaker #B: I only have I'm good here say a day.\
[] Speaker #A: Stop fucking it up for me. Because if I can't stay in flow state none of this work.\
[] Speaker #B: Because having a voicemail is even fucking worse than getting a phone call.\
[] Speaker #A: People don't even leave me voicemails.\
[] Speaker #B: They just call them.\
[] Speaker #A: They just call and call and call and call and because I am very, I'm very good about answering. So I've said the president that if you call me I will answer and will call you back.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure. And you're gonna have to shift that.\
[] Speaker #A: I'm gonna have to get rid of that. Even though I really like that everyone seems really like that responsive. I realistically probably need to shift that.\
[] Speaker #B: To what percentage of that is client and supers and then what percentage of that is like material.\
[] Speaker #A: I pretty much as a person and just good about answering phone.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: I don't think there's anyone that calls me that I maybe one out of a hundred phone calls. I don't answer like I'm call me freak. I know like here's if you called me u tomorrow at any time of the day there's a 95% chance I'd answer within the first few rings. I'm just good about answering the phone.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Because it pisses me off when I need to get answer from I can't get it.\
[] Speaker #B: So I like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But maybe what it is is maybe I just set a hierarchy of priority of if a customer is directly calling me, I'll answer. If a super is directly calling me, I'll answer.\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: Anybody else?\
[] Speaker #B: Okay.\
[] Speaker #A: It probably needs to be can be email or realistically it might be kind of thing where I set a fence where only certain people can call me and I only I need be. So like if you're not on the list to get a hold of me, you just can't get a hold of me and you'renna have to go through someone to get to me that can vet and qualify.\
[] Speaker #B: Exactly.\
[] Speaker #A: Is this an email or do you need to talk to him right now? Yeah, that's probably what needs to happen because there's no good way to create a rule for me to be the one to do that. I have to have a filter.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: That's the only way I can see.\
[] Speaker #B: That'S the only way you can maintain the flow state.\
[] Speaker #A: Because I think protecting the flow state is the only thing that actually makes the business work.\
[] Speaker #B: No, y. We've. These are. These are your. These are your three.\
[] Speaker #A: That's what I need to focus on.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Yeah. And so everything else means. Yeah there's going to be a certain like compromise or change in what you had been managing. But that's. That's what you're saying is the problem is I. You know once. Once seasonally it reaches a certain place you're like it's not. It isn't possible.\
[] Speaker #A: So I really need to be more so really? That's the thing. Yeah. If you call me the offason. Yeah. We can for an hour go get lunch on stuff but real in season what's probablynna have to be. Nope, you can't. If you want to schedule appointment a month out, get on the calendar and if you need to get a hold of me, you got toa go through X Y zp. Sure. I know it sounds pretentious, but it's not. It'not because it. This is the only thing that matters.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. No, I had to tell one of because I freaking hate voicemails. Take that with a grain of salt. You can always call and like client wise it's different I ever call you. I know client wise is different but like the new like new referral stuff. That stuff drives me nuts.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. Well existing customers. Yeah. Fuck. Text me, I'll back to you.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. We have on our voicemail prompt we don't have somebody actively answering the phone. That's just not how our business works. Yeah. Is it will say we will respond much more quickly if you text or email. Yeah. And people are, you know, we will ll get three or four of them day a day and they'll go we're wondering if you take insurance. I'm like it says it in the thing like you know right where that drives me nuts.\
[] Speaker #A: But if that was a phone call you got real task that just ruined your prot.\
[] Speaker #B: Exactly.\
[] Speaker #A: I agree with you. I think that there's.\
[] Speaker #B: There's like protocol type stuff that you can set up.\
[] Speaker #A: I need to create a protocol surrounding how people get a hold and this is my Tim told me because he operates he was where I was and now he's 10, 15 years older than me. 12 years old me he doing 30 million or 50 million dolars a year.\
[] Speaker #B: It's the inevitableion but the thing for.\
[] Speaker #A: Him what he says he's like I had to create systems so it only got to me once. It was a certain level of a problem.\
[] Speaker #B: Ye.\
[] Speaker #A: Because if I was the first person the customer talked to. I'm going toa have an emotional response to what they're feeling. Right. And I cannot operate. I'm a voice by this one. I can't operate.\
[] Speaker #B: You go.\
[] Speaker #A: I can't operate effectively in flow and get anything done if I'm constantly p as an emotional buffer to everyone's issues. Because. But if it comes to says if dad says, hey, there's this problem with the job, what do you think we can do to fix it? I'm have any response, I say, okay, we can do this. If the go, hey, what's good? I'm gonna have this. I have this rejection dysphoria.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: That comes up because of that.\
[] Speaker #B: So what. You know, obviously we won't iron all of these wrinkles out today, but the idea I have on the delegation side, this is how. This is how we. We do it here. From the standpoint of I forward to one of my teammates who's good on the phone like you are. And, you know, we. We figure out via the phone call that. That the person that this person is returning is we just log it the time the. The person that it involved in the topic.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: And then that way that works is just a backstop for you where if someone was like, well, yeah, I called bl blahah blah. And you're like, oh, no, I see it was yesterday time at X time. And it was having to do.\
[] Speaker #A: That's a great idea because then that creates this. This almost object permanence surrounding it being an event.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So then.\
[] Speaker #B: So when you do talk to that.\
[] Speaker #A: Client feel like I have a sense of authority of what's going on. I know when they.\
[] Speaker #B: You know when they call and that it matters to you because you're going, oh, yeah, yeah, you. You called yesterday. Having to do with the, you know, the. The doorknobs or whatever.\
[] Speaker #A: I'CALLING yeah. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #B: And then they're like're like o creates this.\
[] Speaker #A: It removes all that for me while still maintaining the brand experience. Oh, they actually know what.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Because then it. It. It rises to these other cate I.\
[] Speaker #A: Don'T want to be is a answer machine where they can't get a real person and their're first. I hate that for me personally. So I want to create a good experience of what I would expect from a company I work with.\
[] Speaker #B: Y. Yep. The way to leave it here is on the problem protocol, meaning in the first 1.5% is you're orienting the client in some ways to hey, when something comes up, this is how Dom Buil handles it. And this is what you can expect, meaning with the client. That's like splitting all the hairs right now. You would then have pushback and go, hey, you remember that nerdy little problem protocol thing that I talked to you about at the beginning? That also applies here. Yeah. This is why we have that. This is why we have that. I know it's frustrating. I know you're probably anxious to want to get this all wrapped up and finished, but we're used to this dynamic. Yeah. The getting it all finished in the punch list, it kind of can kind of suck.\
[] Speaker #A: It's the nature of the business.\
[] Speaker #B: But, hey, what I want you to remember, what I want you to understand is right where then you're leveraging something that was that you established to in the first one, a half percent. That means that you can maintain flow regardless of how many projects are happening that are wrapping up at the end.\
[] Speaker #A: And really, I think because here's the thing I've been having where I don't necessarily feel the need, I don't know that I necessarily need to turn down work and not continue to grow the business.\
[] Speaker #B: Right.\
[] Speaker #A: I think I need a higher mastery of this concept because I think with a very impeccable execution of this, there's no reason why we could double the worklo we currently have and be more productive than we are right now.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I think it comes down simply.\
[] Speaker #B: It's the role. It's the role in task definition.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. And I think part of the problem with having this really helped me was I know we're about done time. That part of the reason why, if I assume I'm having a hard time delegating, is not because of lack of desire or trying. I think it's because I'm not actually defined these things. And so I'll be trying to then say, hey, Dad, I need you to do this for me. Which is actually first 1.5 or first 5. I should not be asking to do do that. Or I'll say, hey, te can you do this? And pretends to flow.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Text isn't flow. I'm flow. He needs to be on the first 95% of the sale.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: If I asked him to do that, it's going toa stress him out and frshrate him and me and nothing will get done. And all is it just kicks the bucket down the road.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: So I think really what it is, I need to be much more specific about who's responsible for what.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Why. And also assigning, figuring out from like I've like three three things just now ye I need to get better about part of where frustrated I'm not sure how you figured it out was that pertain to the business because of all these hashing out how do I attribute monetary value to what that's worth to me how do I make sure someone feels appreciated that they feel happy doing it and they'making enough money while also not putting an undo straight in my own business and overhead so that's part of the thing here so I think I figured it out would text for the most part and we're ironing it out where I essentially say hey look sell the jobs sell it properly give me all the data I need if we're then profitable because you sold the job properly then there's not all these change orders to adjust for what you did not think about then you'll make x percent if not we're going to split the difference and both take that out. Yeah it's fair yeah on the back end so then to here and think okay well dad and him to do certain things am I going to do the same profit sharing say hey we'x percent if we're on budget he's the finisher he can'control that Right because he's coming to wrap up if we started off wrong that's not his fault.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: So I say here and do I just say here and say all right dad I'm should t pay you by the hour X amount that's fair so whether or not you're there for 50 hours wrapping a project or 10 it's all the sameeah and you don't have to wor about the profitability because you're there to get done not worry about.\
[] Speaker #B: Those things but that's what you do is with your dad you say hey here are the ideas what do you think works what do you think what's going to work for you in terms of how you workate yeah is that's the point is that you then you maintain this ownership spot while at the same time you're you're owning it in the way that you know that it works best for you Meaning like you want to be the the unique you know GC that's like above board and reacting you know and like relating well and so on with with client and.\
[] Speaker #A: I partner kind gc I be hey.\
[] Speaker #B: How'S it going on how are the kids right like that kind of I.\
[] Speaker #A: Want to be in the know and to the point that it freakits people out how well I keep up with what they have going on.\
[] Speaker #B: Hence the something like the log where you call back and go hey, yeah, Allly called yesterday, 2:00 about the shutters. Just you know, checking in with you. Hope stuff's going well. I don't know what your dad's name is but. But, but Tom will be there a little bit later today. Yeah, have a good Friday. Right, like that kind of shit where.\
[] Speaker #A: You just like a personal touch. Because the point is I want to be boutique custom contractor. I don't want to be a volume. Right. I want to create that personal experience. Not different than I get coming to see you, which keeps me coming back because I have a relationship with you. I think that's where I can base my business. Actually. I don't think that that's something that's being serviced in our industry anymore. I think that that's pretty much gone. I think people pay more for that because they want to feel taken care of. Yeah, I'll pay more to go to certain stores to have that one. I know I could buy a suit cheaper from online somewhere.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But I want to go see my tailor and go sit down and talk about it.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah, it's going to Sherwin Williams instead of the Lowe'paint Exactly.\
[] Speaker #A: Something different. They know you.\
[] Speaker #B: So you're going to pay 35% more for paint.\
[] Speaker #A: I want that experience. So I'm trying to find a way as a core value of the business to say hey, this is the most important thing. Quality and relationship Y. So how do we put that at the front of everything we do. And the other problem I have is how do I attribute value to that? Because I have a hard time where a lot of people will say oh this is more expensive than I thought. Great. How do I.\
[] Speaker #B: How do you rem.\
[] Speaker #A: Move myself? How to compete with the cheator? Because I'm trying to. I need to get across to the customer and as a brand that we're not the cheapest but's because we actually give a fuck about you.\
[] Speaker #B: So that problem protocol where you go, that's part of what you're saying. We're not the best but you're gonna have the best experience where here when there's problems or concern over cost to understand that we're not the cheapest but on purpose because of value A, B and C. You're more or less. You're more or less doing this to the client. Your hey client. Your role and task is. Now I'm going to word it in a way that doesn't feel like I'm making you do. Right. But you're going to go oh, okay yeah. What what I can expect and what I will do or get to do is and then that's going to free you up to do some of these like more like kind of cutesy client forward things like hey I know that per Tom the job's going well Just calling to check in on you. You know, how are things going right. People be like what that's because they're not expecting that. Right.\
[] Speaker #A: Or like even like we started doing this thing on bigger jobs that we're do like a physical photo outum before and after. Hey here's yeah your entire house. Here's how shitty was before. Yeah here's the experience. We documented it. Here's photos of us working the whole entire thing. Right here's like mugs or rightch or whatever or like hey, we're doing really good. Your project it wasn't part of a contract we pressure was your whole driver for you just to add that little extra because you want your house look as good as possible. Yeah like taking pride what we do because me I don't give a fuck about the $300 has pressure washed I care about the oh fuck they went above meyond to really make it look great. I wasn t expecting that.\
[] Speaker #B: Right so. So you know how we talked about the micro and macro over here where you can do both ADHD this is more their neurology so when you're saying hey part of what I'm working on here is to try to get the the values kind of more clarified where it's intrinsic to you it's like living it's how you're operating naturally therefore hard to it's hard for ADHD a lot of times to translate that internal value thing and so you doing this role and task work here is what will iron those out will make them very clear as you're focusing on the micro here and it's kind of like dusting off and making the macro more more clear in terms of how you execute some of the other stuff.\
[] Speaker #A: I think with this categorising system I could delg get my phone tomorrow.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah I could really it's not. It's not hard because all because now.\
[] Speaker #A: I see how I could have them answered it does not actually text message. Yeah, I could have an answer. It would not take away from the important thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Right? Yeah yeah is I it it's simple but it's also not compromised and that's how the value clarification the back and forth between these two will work is you'll go hey, I think we need to make a system adjustment. Okay. How do we make that adjustment with our values in mind as opposed to the. This is driving me fucking nuts. Something's got to change. It'll be more like that. Is this helpfule?\
[] Speaker #A: Super helpful. I think it like actually articulates what I'm feeling.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I basically want to take this exact thing and then go have meetings based on every single one of these sheets.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: With everybody text me and that. And because it almost like makes me I'm gonna call text. Hey. I through therapy I've now realised this is a hang up I'm having.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: And this is how I want further define your role to make you more effective and not put under pressure on you where really. Hey. Making sure that the flooring is there is a flow thing. It's on a sales thing. But making sure the flooring not picked out is a sales thing.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: So how do we create these lines? We're all more effect for each other.\
[] Speaker #B: And it doesn't mean that you can't be interchangeable parts. In certain instances only people watch. You can do that because not everyone'good that right.\
[] Speaker #A: Max. Despite the lauageator he can do that. I can have paint one day clean another day. He's like he's just happy to get it done and help. Maybe part of the solution.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Keep that guy around.\
[] Speaker #A: So. Oh 100%. So like I need but how to further define the role and how do I make them feel like they have ownership.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: And they see the value from their rolling tasks to the customer. I think that's the important thing here.\
[] Speaker #B: Yep.\
[] Speaker #A: I like it. Can get picture these real quick.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. Do it. Yeah. Hopefully you can make sense of the hieroglyphicsah and obviously. Yeah. You can text. You can text me or whatever. If you're like what did we mean here?\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. I try to respect your time. If I'm not with you. I try to take as little of your time as possible.\
[] Speaker #B: No, I get it.\
[] Speaker #A: U yeah. This is good.\
[] Speaker #B: And it's nice out. Well I think it's gonna get a little warm today. But still.\
[] Speaker #A: And here's thing like I got multiple things. Four different questions from four different people. But all of them were like I did not need the phone for any of these.\
[] Speaker #B: Is it a group text is yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Just like four different cost three different customers. And then text hey, call me. Get chance. Hey, give me a call back when you can.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Hey I said, okay, great, and I'll give back to you, but obviously there's not a water leak in a house right now.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: So there's no reason me to jump on this.\
[] Speaker #B: Right. And that's when you. What you do is you schedule. That's when you we. You know, remember the Eisenhower matrix? That's when you schedule. Okay, important. But later at this time, I'm gonna. I'm gonna knock all three of these calls out.\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah, no, that makes sense. The thing I'll do is I'll go get in the drive home, make all these phone calls, and then just make it product. So this is super helpful.\
[] Speaker #B: Cause I'm like, It's helpful for me.\
[] Speaker #A: It's super helpful.\
[] Speaker #B: Helpful for me. Cause I'm like, oh, yeah, this is how this goes. All right.\
[] Speaker #A: Cause it's a good review and proof of concept of, like, well, we actually holding to these values or these efficiencies.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah. It would be like if you came back in, you know, two months from now, and you're like, I'm fucking burned. Like, okay, well, we're. Do we need to shift this? And you're like, oh, shit. You like, oh, yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: I forgot about this.\
[] Speaker #B: Right?\
[] Speaker #A: Yeah. The entire time this past week or two since I saw you, I've kept thinking the whole capacity of battery. Yeah, whatever. I'been burned down. Like, I'm just increasing my capacity here. I'm just straining that.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: But it's fine. But this gives me that actionable stuff.\
[] Speaker #B: Sure.\
[] Speaker #A: Before it's awareness. Now we're taking action. We're really setting the foundation. I'm excited.\
[] Speaker #B: Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: Awesome.\
[] Speaker #B: Good, Stu, thanks much, man. Appreciate you. Yeah.\
[] Speaker #A: As always, I'm going to literally go just, like, make this my focus over the entire weekend in the next week.\
[] Speaker #B: Oh, you'll be thinking about me then.\
[] Speaker #A: I will be.\
[] Speaker #B: All right.\
[] Speaker #A: D ye have a good rest of your day.}
