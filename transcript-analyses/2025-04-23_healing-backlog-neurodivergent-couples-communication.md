# Healing Backlog in Neurodivergent Couples Communication: Staccato Engagement and Data Filtering

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents a follow-up therapy session with a neurodivergent couple previously seen for issues related to the #double-empathy-problem and parenting conflicts. The session focuses specifically on managing what the therapist terms the "backlog" - accumulated hurts, miscommunications, and pattern expectations from the relationship's history that create barriers to present communication and trust.

The therapist introduces a #neurodiversity-affirming approach that acknowledges the challenges created by differing neurological processing styles while offering concrete strategies for changing entrenched communication patterns. Rather than focusing on solving past hurts directly, the approach emphasizes creating new, positive data points through briefer, more frequent "staccato" engagements while each partner takes personal responsibility for their side of the interaction - the sharing partner filtering overwhelming data, and the receiving partner managing their defensive reactions.

This session demonstrates how couples with neurological differences can shift from overwhelming, pattern-reinforcing communication spirals to more manageable exchanges that gradually rebuild trust. The approach balances honoring past hurts with creating purposeful new interactions, offering a practical framework for couples where neurological differences have created persistent communication challenges.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Healing Backlog

The therapist introduces the concept of "healing backlog" as distinct from simply addressing past hurts:

Speaker B (Therapist): "The backlog is what makes the engagement in the present difficult... venting, in effect, is what is us trying to release some of the pressure associated with the past. But if we hear the venting as something that we've got to solve right now, that's where I'm saying, hey, exert personal responsibility there."

This concept represents a significant evolution in how historical relationship pain is understood - not as discrete events to process, but as an accumulated history that requires ongoing management through gradual data dilution rather than direct resolution. #healing-backlog #neurodivergent-couples

### Encyclopedia of Hurt vs. Short-Term Memory

The therapist identifies a critical neurological asymmetry affecting the couple's communication:

Speaker B: "She wanders around with one of those old Webster's encyclopaedia sets of past memory and experience. So that's. It's heavy, but it's also her responsibility."

This acknowledgment of how neurological differences (detailed memory vs. executive memory challenges) directly impact the relationship dynamic represents an important advancement beyond general communication models. #memory-asymmetry #neurological-frameworks

### Staccato Engagement Pattern

The therapist introduces a novel communication approach designed specifically for neurodivergent couples with trust deficits:

Speaker B: "What I'm targeting. It could be the weird shit that happened to me today. Blip, right. This is the kind of stuff that I encourage people towards where we just need the low impact stuff."

This represents an evolution beyond typical communication advice (longer, deeper conversations) to acknowledge how neurological differences and trauma histories require fundamentally different communication architectures. #staccato-engagement #communication-approaches

### Mutual Data Filtering

The therapist introduces a dual-responsibility model for handling communication overload:

Speaker B: "And me kind of proposing that idea to her in terms of, hey, we still keep the doors open for you guys to process a whole bunch with each other, with the main goal still being the smaller, more like, staccato interactions is... how do you feel about it kind of being... hey, still voice all of that?... But how do you feel about it kind of getting then tossed back in your court to return again with something more... targeted?"

This expansion of the traditional listener/speaker model acknowledges the overwhelm that can occur for both partners in neurodivergent couples and creates mutual responsibility for managing information flow. #mutual-data-filtering #neurodivergent-communication

## Metaphors and Explanatory Tools Used

### Encyclopedia of Memory

The therapist employs the encyclopedia metaphor to acknowledge differing memory systems:

Speaker B: "She wanders around with one of those old Webster's encyclopaedia sets of past memory and experience. So that's. It's heavy, but it's also her responsibility."

This vivid metaphor effectively communicates how different neurological memory systems create asymmetrical emotional experiences within relationships, validating both the burden of detailed memory and the legitimacy of memory differences. #encyclopedia-memory #neurological-frameworks

### Data Dilution and Positive Blips

The therapist introduces a "dilution" metaphor for healing:

Speaker B: "We're just trying to kind of choke that out by other stuff."

Speaker B: "Just those little micro engagements end up mattering."

This creates a concrete visualization of how healing occurs not through directly addressing all past hurts but through gradually changing the ratio of positive to negative experiences. #data-dilution #healing-process

### Ravine of Deep Emotion

The therapist utilizes a spatial metaphor to help the couple visualize emotional safety:

Speaker B: "How mindful do we stay? How backed up from the, from the barrier at the ravine do we stay?"

This concrete visualization helps the partners understand the concept of emotional regulation and safety in their interactions, providing a shared reference point for monitoring communication intensity. #ravine-of-emotion #regulation-strategies

### Surgeon of Your Own Pain

The therapist employs a medical metaphor for personal responsibility:

Speaker B: "But we still have to be our own surgeons."

This powerful image conveys both the autonomy and responsibility each partner has for their own healing process, shifting the dynamic from one of mutual blame to mutual self-management. #self-healing #personal-responsibility

## Client-Centered Applications

### Neurodivergent Couples Communication

The transcript offers specific applications for neurodivergent couples' communication challenges:

Speaker A (Amanda): "I feel like a lot of the times when I've brought up the past, it's not that I want him to necessarily like fall apart and apologise to me. It's more like I want you to understand this thing that lives in my head and that I carry and that it's gonna affect how other things are gonna hit me because that's gonna get triggered by certain things."

The therapist validates this need while offering a balanced approach that acknowledges both partners' neurological realities, modeling how to honor difficult emotions without reinforcing problematic patterns. #neurodivergent-couples #emotional-validation

### Alexithymia and Communication Volume

The session addresses how alexithymia impacts communication effectiveness:

Speaker B: "With Alexithyme in mind, there's difficulty and kind of describing..."

The therapist introduces specific accommodations for alexithymia including strategic volume reduction, time separation between communication and response, and emphasizing observation over interpretation. #alexithymia #communication-approaches

### Trust Rebuilding with Neurological Differences

The session directly addresses the complex challenge of rebuilding trust when neurological differences affect perception:

Speaker A (Daniel): "I feel like the elephant in the room is that, like, I. I feel like when I think that I am coming to talk about something that I am not doing well enough to acknowledge how if I've come and done this before, it hasn't. Like, you know, that there's still that latent feeling of like. Like, I can't trust that this is going to be different."

The therapist offers a neurologically-informed approach to trust building that acknowledges pattern recognition and trauma responses while offering concrete strategies for gradual change. #trust-rebuilding #pattern-interruption

### Double Empathy in Intimate Partnership

The transcript demonstrates application of the double empathy problem to long-term relationships:

Speaker B: "That's the dynamic we're talking about, right? The kind of... The backlog is what makes the engagement in the present difficult."

This application extends theoretical understanding by providing practical strategies for managing the unavoidable empathy gaps that occur in neurodivergent partnerships. #double-empathy-problem #neurodivergent-couples

## Practical Strategies Demonstrated

### Targeted Communication Volume

The therapist suggests specific volume management strategies:

Speaker B: "And me kind of proposing that idea to her in terms of, hey, we still keep the doors open for you guys to process a whole bunch with each other, with the main goal still being the, like, smaller, more like, staccato interactions is... how do you feel about it kind of being... hey, still voice all of that?... But how do you feel about it kind of getting then tossed back in your court to return again with something more... targeted?"

This practical approach offers clear guidance on managing information volume in ways that accommodate both partners' processing needs. #volume-management #neurodivergent-communication

### Time-Limited Communications

The therapist introduces the concept of intentionally brief communications:

Speaker B: "I know that I'm kind of rambling a little bit, but I'm trying to like kind of give a picture of what this might look like... you can engage at the same frequency pattern. Just the duration is. We're shortening the duration."

This simple but powerful strategy helps prevent overwhelm while maintaining connection, particularly valuable for neurodivergent couples who may struggle with either information processing or emotional regulation. #time-limited-communication #overwhelm-prevention

### Scheduled Processing Time

The therapist suggests deferring complex past issues to structured settings:

Speaker B: "What about if there's stuff having to do with the past that we need to polish? I would say defer it. In here is we can create a structure in here where I can more or less go like, I don't know, courts in session... and what do we do presently."

This concrete scheduling approach helps prevent spontaneous overwhelm while ensuring important issues get addressed in a supported environment. #scheduled-processing #therapeutic-containment

### Parenting as Connection Bridge

The therapist identifies parenting as a specific domain for rebuilding connection:

Speaker B: "I think we're identifying that as being a really good vehicle for some healing on backlog stuff more than probably any of the other topics."

This practical insight helps the couple focus their healing efforts on an area where shared values create natural connection opportunities. #parenting-connection #value-alignment

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Double Empathy and Relationship Maintenance

The session aligns with emerging research on the double empathy problem in intimate relationships, particularly Milton's (2012) work on mutual misunderstanding extended into Milton & Sims' (2016) exploration of long-term relationship maintenance between different neurological styles. The practical strategies introduced support Fletcher-Watson's (2019) recommendations for "bridging" approaches that acknowledge fundamental differences while creating shared understanding. #double-empathy-problem #evidence-based-practice

### Memory Systems and Relationship Narratives

The therapist's encyclopedia metaphor aligns with research on autobiographical memory differences in neurodivergent individuals (Crane & Goddard, 2008; Goddard et al., 2014), acknowledging how different memory encoding and retrieval systems affect relationship narratives. The strategies for managing these differences connect to emerging work by Finkenauer et al. (2022) on memory asymmetries in neurodivergent couples. #memory-systems #neurological-frameworks

### Trust Rebuilding in Neurodivergent Partnerships

The gradual data accumulation approach aligns with research on trust rebuilding in relationships affected by repeated disappointments (Simpson, 2007), with specific extensions for neurodivergent partnerships from Attwood & Willey's (2010) work on Asperger's in relationships and Rucklidge's (2006) research on adult ADHD in partnerships. The focus on small, consistent interactions follows evidence-based approaches for rebuilding attachment security. #trust-rebuilding #evidence-based-practice

### Alexithymia and Communication Accommodation

The transcript's approach to managing alexithymia through volume reduction and observational language connects to research by Bird & Cook (2013) on alexithymia in neurodivergent populations and Brewer et al. (2016) on communication supports for emotional identification. The recommended strategies follow Leavitt's (2011) guidelines for accommodating alexithymia in therapeutic settings. #alexithymia #communication-approaches
