# Three-Part Communication in Neurodivergent Couples: Self-Admission, Empathy, and Ambition

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents a couples therapy session between a therapist (Speaker A) and a neurodivergent couple (Speakers B and C). The session focuses on communication patterns and strategies for navigating neurological differences in their relationship. The therapist demonstrates a #neurodiversity-affirming approach by:

1. Reinforcing a communication sequence of "self-admission, empathy, ambition" that accommodates neurodivergent processing
2. Identifying how neurological differences (like alexithymia and interoception) affect communication
3. Normalizing and reframing adaptive behaviors like fawning and cost-benefit analysis
4. Emphasizing process over content in communication exchanges
5. Creating structured approaches that honor neurological differences while improving connection

The session uses a strengths-based approach, focusing on the couple's existing skills while providing concrete strategies to reduce miscommunications related to neurological differences.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Gateway Prompts for Neurotype-Informed Communication

The therapist introduces a concept of "gateway prompts" that signal cognitive processing modes:

Speaker A: "So what I'd rather you guys have is this kind of like gateway response. More of like the 'oh, yes, absolutely' meaning I'm not in a flow state right now and I'm engaged and like, I'm up for it... It's also going to be like 'I'm in a flow state, non-emotional state. And hey, give me a second.' That's the gateway exchange that I want you to have."

This framework expands traditional communication advice by specifically addressing how neurodivergent processing (alexithymia, cost-benefit analysis) can be acknowledged and accommodated within relationships through explicit signals. #gateway-prompt #neurodivergent-communication

### Operating System Modes and Self-Disclosure

The therapist introduces a conceptual framework for recognizing and disclosing internal processing states:

Speaker A: "What I want you to feel like you can return on... is realizing 'oh I realized that I just like operating system just went online cost benefit beep' is that's what I want you to feel like you can return on and that's working in both directions because she's also got kind of like a default mode that's happening for her on the fawn and so on."

This concept extends beyond typical communication advice by providing neurodivergent individuals with language to identify and communicate about their internal processing modes rather than just the content of their thoughts. #operating-system-mode #metacommunication

## Quotes Illustrating Key Principles

### On Three-Part Communication Sequence

Speaker A: "It's back to that self-admission, empathy, ambition. Both of you did that in terms of y'all's initial exchanges here. Because that's the idea as a repetition of that with the wants. But the idea of bringing or engaging on the wants is what's important."

This exchange demonstrates the structured communication approach the therapist has previously introduced, acknowledging its effectiveness when applied to wants rather than past conflicts. #three-part-communication #wants-focused

### On Neurological Differences and Accommodation

Speaker A: "The majority of what we face in relationships are perpetual. It's how we relate to the perpetual differences that matter. That's why we did all of this neurodivergence work and so on. I was like, well, sorry, we ain't changing. We ain't changing that bit of our neurology here."

This illustrates the therapist's focus on accommodation and adaptation rather than "fixing" neurological differences, acknowledging that many relationship challenges are perpetual. #perpetual-problems #neurodiversity-affirming

### On Fawning as an Adaptive Response

Speaker A: "Fawning is not out and out negative. Sometimes fawning is like empathy, compassion, care... All of the flight, fight, freeze and fawn are all negative when they're on or off too long is how that ends up playing out."

Speaker B: "Is that what you refer to as fawning?"

This exchange demonstrates how the therapist reframes potentially pathologized behaviors as adaptive responses that only become problematic when their timing or duration is mismatched to the situation. #fawn-response #trauma-responses

### On Cost-Benefit Analysis and Communication

Speaker A: "We know categorically that it's more dangerous for humans that are unable to be dishonest than for those that are capable of. There's a really strong correlation between quote unquote dishonesty and intelligence... what's honestly happened is one has done a cost benefit analysis and has given what they're truthfully stating what it is that they're okay with doing but not what they 'quote unquote' would really love to do."

This illustrates the therapist's nuanced view of "honesty" in communication, particularly for neurodivergent individuals who may engage in strategic communication to navigate social expectations. #cost-benefit-analysis #strategic-communication

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Three-Part Communication Sequence

The "self-admission, empathy, ambition" framework aligns with research on effective communication in neurodiverse relationships. Similar to the DEAR MAN approach in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (Linehan, 1993), this structured sequence provides scaffolding that reduces cognitive load. Research by Baker et al. (2022) has shown that structured communication approaches significantly improve relationship satisfaction in neurodivergent couples by providing clear expectations and reducing ambiguity. #communication-frameworks #evidence-based-practice

### Fawn Response in Neurodivergent Adults

The therapist's discussion of the fawn response connects to research on trauma responses in neurodivergent adults. Studies by Pearson and Rose (2021) found that fawning behaviors are common adaptive strategies for many autistic adults who have experienced rejection based on social differences. The therapist's framing of fawning as sometimes adaptive rather than inherently problematic aligns with neurodiversity-affirming clinical approaches that recognize these behaviors as reasonable adaptations to hostile environments. #fawn-response #trauma-informed

### Alexithymia and Interoception

The references to alexithymia (difficulty identifying emotions) and interoception (awareness of internal states) align with research demonstrating their prevalence in autism and ADHD. Shah et al. (2016) found that approximately 50% of autistic individuals experience alexithymia compared to 10% of the general population, while Murphy et al. (2017) documented interoceptive differences in both autism and ADHD. The therapist's approach of directly acknowledging these neurological differences rather than pathologizing them reflects current best practices in neurodiversity-affirming therapy. #alexithymia #interoception

### Cost-Benefit Analysis in Social Communication

The therapist's discussion of cost-benefit analysis in communication decisions aligns with research on compensatory strategies in autism and ADHD. Hull et al. (2021) documented that many autistic adults engage in conscious, strategic decision-making about social responses, which can be exhausting but effective. This connects to the "double empathy problem" described by Milton (2012), which recognizes that communication difficulties stem from bidirectional differences rather than deficits in the neurodivergent partner. #compensatory-strategies #double-empathy-problem
