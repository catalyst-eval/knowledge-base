# Combined Neurotype Experience and Energy Management: Spoon Theory Application for Autism-ADHD

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents a session between a therapist (Speaker A) and a client (Speaker B) who appears to be an autistic individual with ADHD (#combined-neurotype). The session focuses on exploring the client's daily experiences using a "spoon theory" mapping exercise they had been working on between sessions. The therapist demonstrates a #neurodiversity-affirming approach by:

1. Validating the client's experiences without judgment
2. Exploring sensory sensitivities and transitions as energy-depleting experiences
3. Examining how the client has already been accommodating themselves
4. Distinguishing between executive function challenges and values-based routines
5. Working collaboratively to identify potential accommodations that honor neurological differences

The session uses a strengths-based approach, focusing on the client's existing adaptations while developing language and understanding around their neurological experiences to enhance self-advocacy and reduce burnout.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Combined Neurotype Experience (Autism and ADHD)

The therapist acknowledges the client's "neuro spice of both" and articulates how this creates unique challenges:

Speaker A: "Your neuro spice of both is this idea of kind of going like, okay, is this routine or decision or transition? Is it in the value side? Is it in the executive function side? Or is it over here having to do with like interocception? Your relationship to body and self is."

This framework expands the standard conceptual categories by recognizing the dynamic interplay between autistic and ADHD experiences, creating a more nuanced understanding than treating each neurotype separately. #combined-neurotype-experience #neurological-frameworks

### Tropism Model with Attachment Integration

The therapist introduces a visual matrix that combines monotropism/polyotropism with attachment styles, representing an innovative integration of neurological frameworks with relational models:

Speaker A: "It's a matrix associated with the tropism and attachment."

This concept extends beyond typical monotropism theory by explicitly connecting attention patterns to relational dynamics, offering a more integrated view of neurodivergent social experience. #tropism-attachment-matrix #systems-perspectives

### Energy Battery with Varying Capacity

The therapist introduces a concept of energy management that goes beyond traditional spoon theory by suggesting the battery itself is not static:

Speaker A: "With the battery that we're talking about, the battery is not static, meaning the capacity of the battery we can manipulate and change. And that's the point of the accommodation... we're trying to increase the capacity of the battery as well as our awareness of how the battery is being affected per decision, transition routine and so on."

This represents an evolution of energy limitation models by suggesting that accommodations can actually increase capacity, not just manage limited resources. #energy-battery #energy-management

### Mental Mapping Differences Between Autism and ADHD

The therapist articulates neurotype-specific differences in spatial cognition and memory:

Speaker A: "From my standpoint, in terms of how that works, it is more like outside in. So micro detail in... Oftentimes from the autistic experience of the mental mapping, it is more like the linear."

This provides a novel framework for understanding cognitive differences between neurotypes that extends beyond attention or executive function differences. #mental-mapping #cognitive-differences

## Quotes Illustrating Key Principles

### On Sensory Processing and Transitions

Speaker B: "I remember growing up and I would just sit in a ball when I get out of the shower for like 20 minutes because I just like couldn't move."

Speaker A: "Yeah...what's happening per what we talked about like sensory and stuff...multiple things are happening in a transition. Right. It's both an executive function shift and a sensory one."

This exchange demonstrates how sensory experiences intersect with executive function demands during transitions, causing significant energy expenditure. #sensory-processing #transitions

### On Autistic Burnout vs. Depression

Speaker B: "I think I realised yesterday that my whole life I've thought that I was having what I would used to call them as depression spurts [...] was actually burnout."

Speaker A: "That's autistic doom."

Speaker B: "There wasn't like this doom thing or anything like that. It was like just. I can't."

Speaker A: "It was. It's not a mood...It's out of fuel."

This exchange highlights the importance of correctly identifying burnout versus depression, emphasizing how burnout manifests as energy depletion rather than emotional distress. #autistic-burnout #energy-depletion

### On Pathologizing vs. Accommodation

Speaker B: "I always thought my trauma from like I always thought a lot of my things was abandonment... The way that like my therapist structured it was like my need for the routine and familiarity was from abandonment... But learning that I feel... through all aspects of my life, I don't necessarily feel like it's solely correct."

Speaker A: "Yeah, it's hundred percent. Right. And I think this is where, you know, this is where you could, with curiosity in mind, do the whole saying ADHD or autism is not. That's not right. Using. It's using the language or nomenclature we have to describe it."

This exchange demonstrates how neurodiversity-affirming approaches differ from trauma-focused approaches that may pathologize neurodivergent traits as trauma responses. #pathologizing #neurodiversity-affirming

### On Collaborative Accommodations

Speaker A: "The initial accommodation would be in co labouring or in partnership with another working to either preserve enough spoons or coach yourself up on self advocacy enough to where there's a certain strategizing that's happening around the areas that are most consequential."

This illustrates the therapist's approach to accommodation as a collaborative process rather than individual adaptation. #collaborative-accommodations #self-advocacy

### On Self-Advocacy with Partners

Speaker A: "It doesn't mean that I'm playing, I'm not like playing guru or anything like that. It just means that part of what you'll get used to when we go through this...You'll get more used to from an interocceptive standpoint going like running through those levels...frontline accommodation is getting used to this routine of going like huh, weird. And okay, is this executive function, is this value?"

This demonstrates the therapist's focus on building self-awareness as a foundation for self-advocacy. #self-advocacy #interoception

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Spoon Theory and Energy Management

The "spoon theory" discussed throughout the session aligns with Christine Miserandino's original concept, which has been widely adopted in neurodivergent communities. Recent research has validated energy limitation models specifically for autism, with studies showing increased cognitive effort for everyday tasks in autistic individuals (Tyler et al., 2021). The therapist's extension of this theory to include variable battery capacity connects to emerging research on allostatic load and energy regulation in neurodivergent populations. #spoon-theory #energy-management

### Monotropism Theory

The therapist's discussion of the "tropism model" builds on monotropism theory as articulated by Murray, Lesser, and Lawson (2005), which conceptualizes autism as a different pattern of attention allocation. The therapist's integration of monotropism with attachment theory represents an innovative extension of this framework, connecting attention patterns to interpersonal dynamics, similar to recent work by Fletcher-Watson and Happ√© (2019) on the social aspects of monotropic attention. #monotropism #attachment-theory

### Autistic Burnout

The differentiation between depression and autistic burnout aligns with emerging research on autistic burnout, particularly Raymaker et al.'s (2020) study "Having All of Your Internal Resources Exhausted Beyond Measure and Being Left with No Clean-Up Crew," which identified burnout as distinct from depression and characterized by chronic exhaustion, reduced functioning, and increased autism traits following periods of accommodation demands. #autistic-burnout #evidence-based-practice

### Sensory Processing in Autism and ADHD

The discussion of sensory sensitivities, particularly around temperature regulation and transition from shower, aligns with research on sensory processing differences in autism and ADHD (Marco et al., 2011). Recent studies have found that over 90% of autistic individuals experience sensory processing differences, with research by Green and Ben-Sasson (2010) showing correlations between sensory overresponsivity and anxiety. #sensory-processing #evidence-based-practice

### Combined Neurotype Experience

The therapist's nuanced approach to the client's combined autism-ADHD presentation is supported by research on the overlap between these conditions, with Antshel and Russo (2019) noting that 30-80% of individuals with ADHD display autistic traits, and vice versa. Their work emphasizes the need for treatment approaches that address the unique challenges of co-occurring conditions rather than treating each separately. #combined-neurotype #evidence-based-practice

## Recommendations for Framework Additions or Modifications

### Expand the "Regulatory Models" Category 

To include the concept of "Energy Battery with Variable Capacity" - This moves beyond static depletion models to include the idea that accommodations and adaptations can actually increase overall capacity, not just manage limitations. #regulatory-models #energy-battery

### Add "Combined Neurotype Experiences" as a Conceptual Category

Given the high co-occurrence of autism, ADHD, and other neurodevelopmental conditions, having a framework section dedicated to the unique challenges and strengths of combined neurotypes would be valuable. This would include:
- Distinguishing between executive function and values-based aspects of routines
- Identifying competing cognitive patterns and their impacts
- Strategies for leveraging strengths of one neurotype to support challenges of the other

#combined-neurotype-experience #neurological-frameworks

### Enhance the "Metaphors and Explanatory Tools" section to include:

- Mental Mapping Differences - The contrast between autism's "Google Street View" navigation versus ADHD's "micro detail" approach
- Monotropism-Attachment Matrix - The integration of attention patterns with attachment styles
- Battery with Variable Capacity - A refinement of spoon theory that includes capacity-building

#metaphors #explanatory-tools

### Add "Self-Perception and Neurological Identity" as a Client-Centered Application

The transcript reveals the importance of helping clients distinguish between pathologized interpretations of their experiences (e.g., "depression spurts") and neurodiversity-affirming ones (e.g., "autistic burnout"). This category would include:
- Reframing past experiences through neurodiversity lens
- Distinguishing between co-occurring conditions and neurological differences
- Building language for self-advocacy around neurological identity

#self-perception #neurodiversity-affirming

### Expand "Communication Approaches" to include Transition Supports

The transcript shows how communication around upcoming changes or demands can be structured to reduce autonomy threats. This would include:
- "Softened startups" for introducing demands
- Multi-modality options (text vs. verbal communication)
- Temporal spacing of demand introduction and demand response

#communication-approaches #transitions

### Add "Interocceptive Awareness" to Sensory-Informed Interventions

The transcript highlights the importance of building awareness of internal states, particularly around:
- Hunger/eating regulation affected by executive function
- Temperature sensitivity and regulation
- Recognition of energy depletion signals before burnout

#interoception #sensory-informed-interventions

### Create a "Partial Accommodation" category under Family Systems Interventions

The transcript demonstrates how sometimes complete accommodations aren't possible, but partial ones (like the grocery store pickup + produce shopping example) can significantly reduce energy expenditure while maintaining function. #partial-accommodation #accommodation-strategies

These additions would enhance the framework's ability to capture the nuanced clinical insights demonstrated in this session while providing more concrete guidance for clinicians adopting similar neurodiversity-affirming approaches.
