# Parenting Neurodivergent Adolescents: Collaborative Accommodations and Family Communication

## Summary of Key Insights

This transcript documents a session between a therapist (Speaker A) and a parent (Speaker B) who appears to be discussing challenges with parenting neurodivergent adolescents, particularly around school attendance, medication adherence, and family communication. The therapist demonstrates a #neurodiversity-affirming approach by:

1. Validating the reality of autistic burnout and its impact on school functioning
2. Focusing on accommodation and external scaffolding rather than forced compliance
3. Acknowledging the role of parental neurodivergence in family dynamics
4. Promoting collaborative problem-solving through explicit written plans
5. Recognizing intergenerational patterns while supporting parent self-efficacy

The session uses a strengths-based approach, focusing on creating systems that respect neurological differences while providing necessary structure for both parents and children.

## Novel Concepts Identified

### Collaborative Written Accommodations as External Scaffolding

The therapist emphasizes the importance of creating explicit written plans as external scaffolding:

Speaker A: "What I would like for us to try to do is can we collaborate?... I want to try to get myself down on paper where it's about, like, hey, you and I talking even about, hey, what. Okay. What are your goals with Ella? Just Mark and Ella, where you write, like, something like that, where you have something that exists like that...Is it's going to help you for your kind of working memory and so on to be supported in that way."

This framework expands the standard conceptual categories by recognizing how written planning serves a dual purpose: creating clarity across different neurodivergent processing styles while also providing external executive function scaffolding for parents themselves. #external-scaffolding #working-memory

### One-Percent Adjustments in Neurodivergent Family Systems

The therapist introduces a concept of small, cumulative changes:

Speaker A: "It's probably likely that the friction between the two of them is actually going to be really beneficial for them over the long haul as they continue to make these, like, 1% adjustments."

This concept extends beyond typical parenting advice by acknowledging that in neurodivergent family systems, dramatic change is often destabilizing, while small consistent adjustments can accumulate meaningfully over time without overwhelming the system's capacity for adaptation. #one-percent-adjustments #incremental-change

## Quotes Illustrating Key Principles

### On Autistic Burnout and School Refusal

Speaker A: "Yeah, I know it's not good. But it's also not like irreparable damage type stuff either...Some of this is on this, like kind of burnout, depression. It doesn't matter how you try to cajole her or whatever. She's just miserable."

Speaker A: "Yeah. I don't think it's the medicine that's causing it or not causing it from the standpoint of the person kill or let themselves die because of depression and autistic burnout. You've been there."

These exchanges demonstrate the therapist's recognition of autistic burnout as a legitimate experience requiring accommodation rather than just behavioral intervention. #autistic-burnout #school-refusal

### On Parental Executive Function and External Scaffolding

Speaker A: "I'm gonna make you come in here with a notepad from now on. You probably don't want a notepad. You probably just want to type it or whatever...But I've learned over time that the only way that I can really accommodate myself in terms of staying within a tolerable range and not just financially in terms of parenting, in terms of my work life or whatever, because I'll get lost in the midst of it."

This illustrates how the therapist normalizes external scaffolding needs for parents while connecting it to how this helps create a more regulated family environment. #executive-function #external-scaffolding

### On Medication Support vs. Monitoring

Speaker A: "If the demand associated with taking the medication leads to her being dishonest at times. How do we remove the opportunity for the dishonesty? Okay, so it means that the kid's taking the medication in front of the parent or the parent brings the medication to the child and just says, hey, no big deal, and here's your juice of choice with it. Right?"

This demonstrates a pragmatic approach to medication adherence that reduces conflict while maintaining necessary structure. #medication-adherence #practical-supports

### On Working with ADHD and Impulsivity in Parenting

Speaker A: "It's impulsive. Okay. Right. From the ADHD standpoint, it's impulsive. Right. It's that kind of. I got too much going on. Multiple thoughts at once. Right. I know what that experience is like and that's why I'm going like, hey, Mark, I've told her over and over again, hey, try to get, try to support yourself in some way. Make these accommodations, get stuff out on paper or in a way that's going to help you feel more structured."

This exchange shows how the therapist directly connects ADHD traits to parenting challenges while offering concrete accommodation strategies. #adhd-parenting #accommodations

## Research Validation and Connections to Existing Literature

### Autistic Burnout and School Functioning

The therapist's approach to school refusal as potentially related to autistic burnout aligns with recent research by Raymaker et al. (2020), which identified autistic burnout as a distinct phenomenon characterized by chronic exhaustion, increased autism traits, and reduced functioning following periods of high accommodation demands. Studies by Cage and Troxell-Whitman (2019) found that autistic adolescents are particularly vulnerable to burnout during periods of transition or when facing increased social demands, as occurs in middle school environments. #autistic-burnout #evidence-based-practice

### External Scaffolding for Executive Function

The emphasis on written plans and external scaffolding connects to research on executive function interventions for both neurodivergent parents and children. Langberg et al. (2018) found that external organizational systems significantly improved outcomes for adolescents with ADHD, while Fabiano et al. (2021) demonstrated that parent-implemented organizational strategies were most effective when parents themselves received executive function support. #executive-function #organizational-supports

### Collaborative Problem-Solving

The therapist's recommendation for collaborative written plans aligns with Ross Greene's Collaborative & Proactive Solutions model (2016), which has shown efficacy for neurodivergent youth. This approach emphasizes identifying and addressing the underlying factors contributing to challenging behavior rather than focusing solely on the behavior itself. Research by Epstein et al. (2020) found that collaborative problem-solving approaches resulted in greater medication adherence and reduced family conflict compared to behavioral management alone. #collaborative-problem-solving #medication-adherence

### Intergenerational Patterns in Neurodivergent Families

The discussion about intergenerational patterns connects to research on the broader autism phenotype in families. Studies by Losh et al. (2017) found that parents of autistic children often share subclinical traits, which can influence both communication patterns and parenting approaches. The therapist's focus on identifying these patterns without blame aligns with Constantino and Charman's (2016) recommendations for family-centered interventions that acknowledge neurological diversity within family systems. #intergenerational-patterns #family-systems
