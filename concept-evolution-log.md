## Relationships Between Concepts

### Monotropism & Autistic Inertia
The connection between monotropic attention and transition difficulties forms a key relationship in our framework. Monotropism helps explain why transitions are so challenging (intense focus is difficult to shift), while autistic inertia provides a descriptive framework for the experience. These concepts together inform transition management strategies.

### Bottom-Up Processing & Sensory Regulation
The 80/20 model of bottom-up processing provides the theoretical foundation for prioritizing sensory and physiological regulation before cognitive approaches. This relationship establishes the sequence of intervention: address sensory needs first, then emotional regulation, and finally cognitive understanding.

### Combined Neurotype & Executive Function
Understanding the interaction between autism and ADHD in combined neurotypes reveals both complementary and competing neurological patterns. This relationship influences how we approach executive function supports, recognizing the unique challenges that arise at this intersection.

### Interest-Based Nervous System & Educational Approaches
The concept of interest-based motivation directly informs educational accommodations, suggesting that engagement will be highest when connected to intrinsic interests rather than external rewards. This relationship challenges traditional educational motivation systems for neurodivergent students.

### Interoception & Regulatory Models
Interoception serves as a foundational component of emotional regulation, with awareness of internal bodily states being a prerequisite for effective self-regulation. This relationship emphasizes the importance of developing bodily awareness in neurodivergent individuals as part of a comprehensive approach to improving regulatory capacity.

### Post-Separation Dynamics & Communication Protocols
The understanding of post-separation dynamics directly informs the development of structured communication protocols, with boundary enforcement strategies being essential to maintaining healthy separation while co-parenting effectively. This relationship emphasizes the importance of formalized communication boundaries in high-conflict relationships.
