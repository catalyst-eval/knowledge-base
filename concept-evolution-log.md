# Concept Evolution Log

This document tracks the evolution of key concepts in our neurodiversity-affirming clinical knowledge base. Each entry indicates how understanding has developed over time, with version numbers corresponding to those in transcript analysis front matter.

## Neurological Frameworks

### interest-based-nervous-system
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Initial conceptualization focusing on attention allocation and motivation in autism/ADHD being guided by interest rather than external demands
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### monotropism
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Described in terms of "attention tunneling" with emphasis on transitions and task-switching challenges
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### combined-neurotype-experience
- **v1 (04-15-2025)**: Initial description of the unique neurological experience of individuals with both autism and ADHD, highlighting the interplay between different aspects of both conditions
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### autistic-inertia
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Conceptualized as difficulty initiating or changing activities, using the "lighthouse" analogy for attention focus
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

## Regulatory Models

### bottom-up-processing
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Presented as the "80/20 model" where 80% of neural processing is bottom-up (sensory/physiological) and 20% is top-down (cognitive)
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### energy-management
- **v1 (04-15-2025)**: Initially based on traditional spoon theory with fixed resource limitations
- **v2 (04-15-2025)**: Evolved to include the "energy battery with variable capacity" concept, suggesting accommodations can increase capacity, not just manage limitations
- **v3**: *[Future development]*

### co-regulation
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Introduced as parent-child regulatory relationship with emphasis on parental regulation state affecting child
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

## Metaphors and Explanatory Tools

### tropism-model
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Botanical metaphor applied to attention styles (monotropism, polyotropism, varotropism)
- **v2 (04-15-2025)**: Expanded to include attachment integration ("tropism-attachment matrix")
- **v3**: *[Future development]*

### ice-pick-on-slope
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Metaphor for dysregulation (sliding down hill) and regulation strategies (arresting fall)
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### energy-battery
- **v1 (04-15-2025)**: Extension of spoon theory emphasizing variable capacity rather than fixed resources
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### dialectical-pairs
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Applied specifically to autonomy/avoidance tensions in autistic experience
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

## Practical Strategies

### three-part-communication
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Introduced as Self-Admission, Empathy, Ambition sequence for engaging with dysregulated individuals
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### collaborative-problem-solving
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Emphasis on scheduled, proactive problem-solving when everyone is regulated
- **v2 (04-15-2025)**: Expanded to include "co-labouring" and partnership in accommodation development
- **v3**: *[Future development]*

### partial-accommodation
- **v1 (04-15-2025)**: Strategic implementation of partial accommodations that balance needs with limited resources
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

## Client-Centered Applications

### neurodivergent-youth-support
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Focus on parent education about neurological differences to shift understanding of behavior
- **v2**: *[Future development]*

### transition-management
- **v1 (04-23-2025)**: Identified as particularly challenging for autistic youth, with strategies focused on sensory approaches
- **v2 (04-15-2025)**: Expanded to include understanding of combined neurotype transition challenges and considerations of executive function and sensory processing occurring simultaneously
- **v3**: *[Future development]*

## Relationships Between Concepts

### Monotropism & Autistic Inertia
The connection between monotropic attention and transition difficulties forms a key relationship in our framework. Monotropism helps explain why transitions are so challenging (intense focus is difficult to shift), while autistic inertia provides a descriptive framework for the experience. These concepts together inform transition management strategies.

### Bottom-Up Processing & Sensory Regulation
The 80/20 model of bottom-up processing provides the theoretical foundation for prioritizing sensory and physiological regulation before cognitive approaches. This relationship establishes the sequence of intervention: address sensory needs first, then emotional regulation, and finally cognitive understanding.

### Combined Neurotype & Executive Function
Understanding the interaction between autism and ADHD in combined neurotypes reveals both complementary and competing neurological patterns. This relationship influences how we approach executive function supports, recognizing the unique challenges that arise at this intersection.

### Interest-Based Nervous System & Educational Approaches
The concept of interest-based motivation directly informs educational accommodations, suggesting that engagement will be highest when connected to intrinsic interests rather than external rewards. This relationship challenges traditional educational motivation systems for neurodivergent students.
