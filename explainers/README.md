# Topic-Specific Explainer Articles

This directory contains comprehensive explainer articles that synthesize information from multiple transcript analyses into clinically useful resources on specific concepts, techniques, and frameworks.

## Purpose

The explainer articles serve as:

1. **Knowledge Synthesis** - Combine insights from multiple transcript analyses into cohesive, comprehensive resources
2. **Clinical Education** - Provide therapists with tools to understand and explain complex concepts
3. **Practical Application** - Offer concrete strategies, scripts, and case examples for implementing concepts in clinical practice
4. **Research Integration** - Connect clinical observations with academic research and evidence-based practices

## Structure

Each explainer follows a standardized format:

- **Clinical Description** - Technical definition for professional understanding
- **Client-Friendly Explanations** - Accessible definitions and metaphors for use with clients
- **Neurological Basis** - Evidence-based information on neurological underpinnings when available
- **Clinical Manifestations** - How the concept presents in therapeutic settings
- **Therapeutic Approaches** - Specific techniques with rationales and implementation examples
- **Case Examples** - Anonymized clinical scenarios demonstrating the concept in practice
- **Evolution of Understanding** - How conceptualization has developed over time
- **Research Connections** - Links to academic research supporting the concept
- **Related Concepts** - Connections to other concepts in the knowledge base
- **References** - Links to transcript analyses and academic citations

## Weekly Update Process

Explainer articles are updated weekly based on new transcript analyses:

1. New analyses are reviewed for concepts that require new explainer articles or updates to existing ones
2. Novel information is extracted and synthesized into the standardized format
3. Direct quotes from transcripts are anonymized and enhanced for clinical clarity
4. Research connections are updated with relevant academic findings
5. All updates are logged in the `explainer-updates-log.md` file

## Using These Resources

Clinicians can use these explainers to:

- **Develop Understanding** - Build comprehensive knowledge of complex concepts
- **Prepare for Sessions** - Review practical strategies and scripts before working with clients
- **Explain Concepts** - Use client-friendly definitions and metaphors during sessions
- **Implement Approaches** - Follow concrete implementation guidelines for therapeutic techniques
- **Connect Research** - Link clinical practice to evidence-based research

## Template

When creating new explainers, use the `explainer-template.md` file to ensure consistency in format and content.

## Updates Log

All changes to explainer articles are documented in the `explainer-updates-log.md` file in the root directory.
