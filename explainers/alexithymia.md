# Alexithymia in Neurodivergent Experience

## Clinical Description

Alexithymia refers to difficulty identifying and describing emotional states, and is commonly present in neurodivergent individuals. It manifests as challenges in connecting physiological sensations to emotional labels, expressing feelings verbally, and distinguishing between different emotional states. This is not the result of disinterest in emotions, but rather a neurological difference in how emotional information is processed and translated into conscious awareness and verbal expression.

## Explaining Alexithymia to Clients

### Client-Friendly Definition

"Alexithymia is like having emotional experiences without automatic labels for them. You might feel something strongly in your body – tightness in your chest, a knot in your stomach, or energy in your limbs – but translating that sensation into a specific emotion word like 'anxious,' 'disappointed,' or 'excited' requires extra steps that might not happen automatically. This isn't about lacking emotions; it's about how your brain processes the connection between physical sensations and emotional language."

### Metaphors That Resonate

**The Foreign Language Metaphor**: "Imagine emotions are being broadcast in a language you didn't grow up speaking. You can hear all the sounds and might recognize the general tone (positive/negative), but translating the specific meaning requires conscious effort rather than happening automatically."

**The Unlabeled Spice Cabinet**: "Picture a spice cabinet where all the containers are identical and none have labels. You can taste each spice and know they're different, but naming each one accurately takes time and practice."

## Neurological Basis

Research suggests alexithymia involves reduced connectivity between interoception centers (which detect internal bodily sensations) and language processing regions in the brain. This creates a "translation gap" between physical sensations and the language needed to identify and express them. Alexithymia is prevalent across neurodivergent populations, with studies showing rates of 40-65% in autistic individuals and 30-45% in those with ADHD.

## Clinical Manifestations

In therapeutic settings, alexithymia often presents as:

- Detailed descriptions of physical sensations without emotional labels
- Difficulty answering questions about feelings
- Delayed emotional processing that becomes clearer hours or days after events
- Tendency toward binary emotional states (fine/not fine) rather than nuanced descriptions
- Reliance on learned rather than intuitive emotional language

## Therapeutic Approaches

### 1. Volume Reduction

**Clinical Rationale**: Processing emotional communication requires additional cognitive resources for individuals with alexithymia. Reducing the volume of information helps prevent overload and allows focus on quality over quantity.

**Implementation Example**:

*Anonymized and Enhanced for Clinical Use*:

"When working with a client with alexithymia, I find it helpful to suggest 'communication volume control.' I might say:

'I notice it can be challenging to process lots of emotional information at once. What if we try shorter check-ins more frequently, rather than saving up for one big discussion? This gives your brain time to process each piece before moving to the next. You can still share everything that's important, but in smaller, more manageable chunks.'"

**Concrete Strategy**:
- Recommend 5-10 minute check-ins rather than hour-long emotional discussions
- Suggest text communication for complex emotions to allow processing time
- Create a shared signal for "information overload" that either partner can use

### 2. Observational vs. Interpretive Language

**Clinical Rationale**: Focusing on observable experiences reduces the cognitive demand of translating physical sensations directly into abstract emotional labels.

**Implementation Example**:

*Anonymized and Enhanced for Clinical Use*:

"When training couples in communication that accommodates alexithymia, I teach the distinction between observational and interpretive language. I might explain:

'Instead of starting with "I feel anxious" (which requires emotional labeling), try describing what's happening in your body or thoughts: "My chest feels tight and I'm thinking about all the things that could go wrong." This observational language is often more accessible and gives your partner more specific information about your experience.'"

**Script for Teaching Clients**:
"Try using this format: 'When [situation happens], I notice [physical sensation or thought pattern], and it makes me want to [behavioral response].' This creates a bridge between experience and communication without requiring immediate emotional labeling."

### 3. Temporal Separation

**Clinical Rationale**: Delayed emotional processing is common with alexithymia. Creating time between experiences and discussions allows for more accurate identification of emotions.

**Implementation Example**:

*Anonymized and Enhanced for Clinical Use*:

"I often explain to clients with alexithymia that emotional processing can have a delay, similar to how developing a photograph used to take time. I might suggest:

'When your partner asks how you feel about something important, it's perfectly valid to say, "I need to process that. Can we talk about it tomorrow after I've had time to check in with myself?" This isn't avoidance – it's actually taking emotional processing seriously enough to give it the time it requires.'"

**Practical Application in Therapy**:
- Normalize "processing time" as a legitimate need rather than avoidance
- Encourage journaling between sessions to track physical sensations
- Use follow-up questions in subsequent sessions that connect previous physiological descriptions to potential emotional states

## Case Examples

### Case 1: Couple Therapy Communication Bridge

A married couple (one partner autistic with alexithymia, one neurotypical) came to therapy for communication difficulties. The neurotypical partner felt their spouse "didn't care" because they rarely expressed emotions during conflicts.

During one session, when discussing a recent argument, the partner with alexithymia described their experience: "I felt hot all over and my thoughts were racing. I just wanted to leave the room until things calmed down."

Rather than interpreting this as avoidance, we reframed it as valuable data about their internal experience. Together, we explored how these physical sensations might connect to emotions like feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or protective. Over time, the couple developed a shared vocabulary connecting specific physical experiences to emotional states, which significantly improved their mutual understanding.

### Case 2: Building Emotional Literacy Through Physical Awareness

An adult client with combined autism/ADHD struggled with identifying emotions beyond "good" and "bad." We implemented a body-mapping approach where they would check in with different areas of their body during significant events.

After practicing this for several weeks, they reported a breakthrough: "I realized I actually have different types of 'bad' feelings. When my shoulders and jaw are tight, that's usually anger. When my stomach feels hollow, that's usually sadness or disappointment."

This increased emotional granularity allowed them to communicate more effectively with family members and respond more appropriately to their own emotional needs.

## Evolution of Understanding

Understanding of alexithymia in neurodivergent contexts has evolved from viewing it as an emotional deficit to recognizing it as a different mode of emotional processing that requires specific accommodations and translation support. While earlier clinical approaches often tried to "fix" the alexithymia directly, current neurodiversity-affirming approaches focus on creating bridges between physiological experience and emotional communication, respecting the neurological differences while enhancing functional communication and self-awareness.

## Research Connections

Research by Bird & Cook (2013) established alexithymia as a major contributor to emotional processing differences in autism, independent of autism itself. This groundbreaking work helped separate autism-specific traits from alexithymia-related traits, showing that many emotional processing differences previously attributed to autism are actually related to co-occurring alexithymia.

Brewer et al. (2016) extended this work by connecting alexithymia to broader interoception challenges, suggesting that difficulty identifying emotions stems from a more fundamental difference in how bodily sensations are detected and interpreted.

Recent work by Kinnaird et al. (2019) has explored alexithymia in ADHD populations, finding similar prevalence rates and manifestations as in autism, though potentially through different neurological pathways.

## Related Concepts

- **Interoception**: Alexithymia is closely related to interoception challenges, as difficulty sensing internal states contributes to difficulty labeling emotions. Improving interoceptive awareness often supports emotional identification.

- **Three-Part Communication**: This framework provides specific structure to support emotional expression for those with alexithymia by creating a scaffolded approach that reduces cognitive load during emotional exchanges.

- **Double Empathy Problem**: Alexithymia contributes to mutual misunderstanding in neurodivergent relationships where partners may have different emotional processing styles, requiring active accommodation from both sides.
