# Neurodiversity-Affirming Clinical Knowledge Base

This repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge base of clinical insights, therapeutic approaches, and practical strategies for neurodiversity-affirming therapy. It contains analyzed clinical transcripts organized with a consistent tagging structure to facilitate knowledge discovery and application.

## Getting Started

Browse the [main index](index.md) to explore analyses by category, or navigate to specific [concept](index_concepts.md), [neurotype](index_neurotype.md), [client type](index_client_type.md), [presenting issue](index_presenting_issue.md), [metaphor](index_metaphors.md), or [strategy](index_strategies.md) indexes.

## Project Vision

To create a comprehensive knowledge base from client transcripts that captures unique clinical insights, neurodiversity-affirming perspectives, and practical therapeutic strategies. This resource serves multiple purposes:

1. Foundation for a potential book on evidence-based, neurodiversity-affirming therapeutic approaches
2. Source material for blog content that benefits both clients and clinicians
3. Training resource for clinicians 
4. Reference library showcasing a collaborative, relationship-focused therapeutic approach

## Repository Structure

- **Transcript Analyses**: Markdown files in the root directory containing analyzed clinical transcripts
- **Tag Glossary**: `tag-glossary.md` defines all standardized tags used throughout the knowledge base
- **Concept Evolution Log**: `concept-evolution-log.md` tracks how concepts evolve over time
- **Index Files**: Generated files that organize analyses by different categories
- **Templates**: Standard formats for creating new analyses
- **Automation**: Scripts for validating tags, suggesting new tags, and updating indexes

## Core Organizational Framework

The knowledge base is organized around these main conceptual areas:

1. **Neurological Frameworks** (interest-based nervous systems, monotropism, etc.)
2. **Regulatory Models** (bottom-up processing, dysregulation cascades, co-regulation)
3. **Systems Perspectives** (family dynamics, educational systems impact)
4. **Developmental Considerations** (age-appropriate interventions)
5. **Communication Approaches** (three-part sequence: self-admission, empathy, ambition)
6. **Metaphors and Explanatory Tools** (tropism model, ice pick on a slope, etc.)

For client-centered applications, content is organized by:

1. **Neurodivergent Youth Support** (autism, ADHD, school challenges)
2. **Parent Coaching Strategies** (collaborative problem-solving)
3. **Family Systems Interventions** (dialectical approaches to family conflict)
4. **Transition Management** (school-to-home, life changes)
5. **Sensory-Informed Interventions** (regulation techniques)

## Navigation

This knowledge base uses several methods for navigation:

- **Tag-Based Browsing**: Index files organize content by tag categories
- **Search**: GitHub's search functionality allows finding specific concepts
- **Cross-References**: Related analyses are linked at the end of each document

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidance on adding new transcript analyses, using the tagging system, and maintaining consistency across the knowledge base.
